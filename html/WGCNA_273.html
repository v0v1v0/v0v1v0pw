<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>datExpr</code></td>
<td>
<p> expression data. A data frame in which columns are genes and rows ar samples. NAs are
allowed, but not too many. </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>weights</code></td>
<td>
<p>optional observation weights for <code>datExpr</code> to be used in correlation calculation. 
A matrix of the same dimensions as
<code>datExpr</code>, containing non-negative weights.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>corType</code></td>
<td>
<p> character string specifying the correlation to be used. Allowed values are (unique
abbreviations of) <code>"pearson"</code> and <code>"bicor"</code>, corresponding to Pearson and bidweight
midcorrelation, respectively. Missing values are handled using the <code>pairwise.complete.obs</code> option. </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>networkType</code></td>
<td>
<p> network type. Allowed values are (unique abbreviations of) <code>"unsigned"</code>,
<code>"signed"</code>, <code>"signed hybrid"</code>. See <code>adjacency</code>. </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>power</code></td>
<td>
<p> soft-thresholding power for netwoek construction. </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>TOMType</code></td>
<td>
<p> one of <code>"none"</code>, <code>"unsigned"</code>, <code>"signed"</code>, <code>"signed Nowick"</code>,
<code>"unsigned 2"</code>, <code>"signed 2"</code> and <code>"signed Nowick 2"</code>. If <code>"none"</code>, adjacency
will be used for clustering. See details and keep in mind that the "2" versions should be considered experimental and are
subject to change.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>TOMDenom</code></td>
<td>
<p> a character string specifying the TOM variant to be used. Recognized values are 
<code>"min"</code> giving the standard TOM described in Zhang and Horvath (2005), and <code>"mean"</code> in which 
the <code>min</code> function in the denominator is replaced by <code>mean</code>. The <code>"mean"</code> may produce
better results but at this time should be considered experimental.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>maxPOutliers</code></td>
<td>
<p> only used for <code>corType=="bicor"</code>. Specifies the maximum percentile of data
that can be considered outliers on either 
side of the median separately. For each side of the median, if
higher percentile than <code>maxPOutliers</code> is considered an outlier by the weight function based on
<code>9*mad(x)</code>, the width of the weight function is increased such that the percentile of outliers on
that side of the median equals <code>maxPOutliers</code>. Using <code>maxPOutliers=1</code> will effectively disable
all weight function broadening; using <code>maxPOutliers=0</code> will give results that are quite similar (but
not equal to) Pearson correlation. </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>quickCor</code></td>
<td>
<p> real number between 0 and 1 that controls the handling of missing data in the
calculation of correlations. See details. </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pearsonFallback</code></td>
<td>
<p>Specifies whether the bicor calculation, if used, should revert to Pearson when median 
absolute deviation (mad) is zero. Recongnized values are (abbreviations of) 
<code>"none", "individual", "all"</code>. If set to
<code>"none"</code>, zero mad will result in <code>NA</code> for the corresponding correlation. 
If set to <code>"individual"</code>, Pearson calculation will be used only for columns that have zero mad. 
If set to <code>"all"</code>, the presence of a single zero mad will cause the whole variable to be treated in 
Pearson correlation manner (as if the corresponding <code>robust</code> option was set to <code>FALSE</code>). Has no
effect for Pearson correlation. See <code>bicor</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cosineCorrelation</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical: should the cosine version of the correlation calculation be used? The 
cosine calculation differs from the standard one in that it does not subtract the mean. </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>replaceMissingAdjacencies</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical: should missing values in the calculation of adjacency be
replaced by 0?</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>suppressTOMForZeroAdjacencies</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical: should the result be set to zero for zero adjacencies?</p>
</td>

<td><code>suppressNegativeTOM</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical: should the result be set to zero when negative?</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>useInternalMatrixAlgebra</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical: should WGCNA's own, slow, matrix multiplication be used instead of
R-wide BLAS? Only useful for debugging.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nThreads</code></td>
<td>
<p> non-negative integer specifying the number of parallel threads to be used by certain
parts of correlation calculations. This option only has an effect on systems on which a POSIX thread
library is available (which currently includes Linux and Mac OSX, but excludes Windows).
If zero, the number of online processors will be used if it can be determined dynamically, otherwise
correlation calculations will use 2 threads. </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p> integer level of verbosity. Zero means silent, higher values make the output
progressively more and more verbose. </p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>indent</code></td>
<td>
<p> indentation for diagnostic messages. Zero means no indentation, each unit adds
two spaces. </p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Several alternate definitions of topological overlap are available. The oldest version is now called "unsigned"; in this
version, all adjacencies are assumed to be non-negative and the topological overlap of nodes <code class="reqn">i,j</code> is given by
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">TOM_{ij} = \frac{a_{ij} + \sum_{k\neq i,j} a_{ik}a_{kj} }{f(k_i, k_j) + 1 - a_{ij}} \, ,</code>
</p>

<p>where the sum is over <code class="reqn">k</code> not equal to either <code class="reqn">i</code> or <code class="reqn">j</code>, the function <code class="reqn">f</code> in the denominator can be
either min or mean (goverened by argument <code>TOMDenom</code>), and <code class="reqn">k_i = \sum_{j\neq i} a_{ij}</code> is
the connectivity of node <code class="reqn">i</code>. The signed versions assume that the adjacency matrix was obtained from an underlying
correlation matrix, and the element <code class="reqn">a_{ij}</code> carries the sign of the underlying correlation of the two
vectors. (Within WGCNA, this can really only apply to the unsigned adjacency since signed adjacencies are (essentially)
zero when the underlying correlation is negative.) The signed and signed Nowick versions are similar to the above unsigned
version, differing only in absolute
values placed in the expression: the signed Nowick expression is
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">TOM_{ij} = \frac{a_{ij} + \sum_{k\neq i,j} a_{ik}a_{kj} }{f(k_i, k_j) + 1 - |a_{ij}|} \, .</code>
</p>

<p>This TOM lies between -1 and 1, and typically is negative when the underlying adjacency is negative. The signed TOM is
simply the absolute value of the signed Nowick TOM and is hence always non-negative. For non-negative
adjacencies, all 3 version give the same result. 
</p>
<p>A brief note on terminology: the original article by Nowick et al use the name "weighted TO" or wTO; since all of the
topological overlap versions calculated in this function are weighted, we use the name signed to indicate that this TOM
keeps track of the sign of the underlying correlation.
</p>
<p>The "2" versions of all 3 adjacency types have a somewhat different form in which the adjacency and the product are
normalized separately. Thus, the "unsigned 2" version is 
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">TOM^{(2)}_{ij} = \frac{1}{2}\left[a_{ij} + \frac{\sum_{k\neq i,j} a_{ik}a_{kj} }{f(k_i, k_j) - a_{ij}}\right] \, .</code>
</p>

<p>At present the relative weight of the adjacency and the normalized product term are equal and fixed; in the future a
user-specified or automatically determined weight may be implemented. The "signed Nowick 2" and "signed 2" are defined
analogously to their original versions. The adjacency is assumed to be signed, and the expression for "signed Nowick 2"
TOM is
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">TOM^{(2)}_{ij} = \frac{1}{2}\left[a_{ij} + \frac{\sum_{k\neq i,j} a_{ik}a_{kj} }{f(k_i, k_j) - |a_{ij}| } \right] \, .</code>
</p>

<p>Analogously to "signed" TOM, "signed 2" differs from "signed Nowick 2" TOM only in taking the absolute value of the result.
</p>
<p>At present the "2" versions should all be considered experimental and are subject to change.

<h2> weighted histogram </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

 
<p>Assume that <code class="reqn">x=(x_1, x_2, \cdots , x_n)</code> is the observed value of a random sample from a fuzzy population. 
In classical and usual random sample, the degree of belonging <code class="reqn">x_i</code> into the random sample is equal to 1, for <code class="reqn">1 \leq i  \leq  n</code>.
But considering fuzzy population, we denote the degree of belonging <code class="reqn">x_i</code> into the fuzzy population (or into the observed value of random sample) by <code class="reqn">\mu_i</code> which is a real-valued number from [0,1].
Therefore in such situations, it is more appropriate that we show the observed value of the random sample by notation <code class="reqn"> \{ (x_1, \mu_1),  (x_2, \mu_2), \cdots , (x_n, \mu_n) \} </code> which we called it real-valued fuzzy data.
This function drow the weighted histogram for a vector-valued data by considering a vector-valued weight. The weighted histogram containes several classical histograms which are depicted on one two-dimentional sorface. Each classical histogram drown only for the elements of real-value fuzzy data set which their weights are bigger than a cut point belongs to (0,1].

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">w.hist(x, mu, breaks, cuts, ylim = NULL, freq = NULL, lwd = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>

<p>A vector-valued numeric data for which the weighted histogram is desired by considering their weights. 
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mu</code></td>
<td>

<p>A vector of weights of the real-value fuzzy data. The length of this vector must be equal to the length of x and each element of it is belongs to interval [0,1].
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>breaks</code></td>
<td>

<p>a vector giving the breakpoints between the weighted histogram cells.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cuts</code></td>
<td>

<p>a vector giving the cut-points between (to determine) the classical histograms in the desired weighted histogram.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>freq</code></td>
<td>

<p>logical; if TRUE, the histogram graphic is a representation of frequencies, the counts component of the result; if FALSE, probability densities, component density, are plotted (so that the histogram has a total area of one). Defaults to TRUE if and only if breaks are equidistant (and probability is not specified).
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ylim</code></td>
<td>

<p>numeric vector of length 2 giving the y limits for the plot. Unused if add = TRUE.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>lwd</code></td>
<td>

<p>The line width, a positive number, defaulting to 1. The interpretation is device-specific, and some devices do not implement line widths less than one. 
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The arguments of the weighted histogram can be extended similar to the arguments of usual histogram which is detailed in function "hist" from "graphics" package.
</p>


<h3>Warning </h3>

<p>The length of x and mu must be equal. Also, each element of mu must be in interval [0,1].

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">n = 5000
x = rnorm(n,17,1)
x[x&lt;14 | x&gt;20] = NA
range(x)
mu = runif(n,0,1)
bre = seq(from=14,to=20,len=18)
cu = seq(from=0,to=1,len=10)
w.hist(x, mu, breaks=bre, cuts=cu, ylim=c(0,n/7), lwd = 2)

## The function is currently defined as
function(x, mu, breaks, cuts, ylim = NULL, freq = NULL, lwd = NULL) 
{
Gray = paste("gray", round(seq(from=10, to=100, len=length(cuts)-1)), sep="")
hist(x, col=Gray[1], xlim=range(breaks), ylim=ylim, breaks=breaks, freq=freq, lwd=lwd)
i=2
while(i&lt;=length(cuts))
{
X=x
X[(X*(mu&gt;=cuts[i]))==0]=NA
hist(X, col=Gray[i], xlim=range(breaks), ylim=ylim, breaks=breaks, freq=freq, lwd=lwd, add=TRUE)
i=i+1

<h2>
Multi-season detection data for grand skinks
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Results of an occupancy survey of 352 rocky outcrops ("tors") looking for grand skinks. Tors were surveyed up to 3 times per year for 5 years. The surrounding terrain was characterised as natural grassland or pasture.
</p>

</dd>
<dt>habitat</dt>

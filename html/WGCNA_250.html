Simple hierarchical consensus calculation
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Hierarchical consensus calculation without calibration. 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">simpleHierarchicalConsensusCalculation(individualData, consensusTree, level = 1)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>individualData</code></td>
<td>

<p>Individual data from which the consensus is to be calculated. It can be either a list or a
<code>multiData</code> structure. Each element in <code>individulData</code> should be a numeric
object (vector, matrix or array).
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>consensusTree</code></td>
<td>

<p>A list specifying the consensus calculation. See details.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>level</code></td>
<td>

<p>Integer which the user should leave at 1.  This serves to keep default set names unique.
</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function calculates consensus in a hierarchical manner, using a separate (and possibly different) set of
consensus options at each step. The "recipe" for the consensus calculation is supplied in the argument
<code>consensusTree</code>.
</p>
<p>The argument <code>consensusTree</code> should have the following components: (1) <code>inputs</code> must be either a
character vector whose components match <code>names(inputData)</code>, or consensus trees in the own right.
(2) <code>consensusOptions</code> must be a list of class <code>"ConsensusOptions"</code> that specifies options for
calculating the consensus. A suitable set of options can be obtained by calling
<code>newConsensusOptions</code>. (3) Optionally, the component <code>analysisName</code> can be a single
character string giving the name for the analysis. When intermediate results are returned, they are returned
in a list whose names will be set from <code>analysisName</code> components, if they exist.
</p>
<p>Unlike the similar function <code>hierarchicalConsensusCalculation</code>, this function ignores the
calibration settings in the <code>consensusOptions</code> component of <code>consensusTree</code>; no calibration of
input data is performed.
</p>
<p>The actual consensus calculation at each level of the consensus tree
is carried out in function <code>simpleConsensusCalculation</code>. The consensus options for each individual
consensus calculation are independent from one another, i.e., the consensus options for different steps can
be different.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list with a single component  <code>consensus</code>, containing the consensus data of the same dimensions as the
individual entries in the input <code>individualData</code>. This perhaps somewhat cumbersome convention is used to
make the output compatible with that of <code>hierarchicalConsensusCalculation</code>.

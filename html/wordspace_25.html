<h2>
A Scored Co-occurrence Matrix of Nouns Denoting Goods (wordspace)
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A pre-scored verb-object co-occurrence matrix for 240 target nouns denoting goods
and the 3 feature verbs <em>own</em>, <em>buy</em> and <em>sell</em>.
This matrix is useful for illustrating the application and purpose of dimensionality reduction techniques.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
DSM_GoodsMatrix

</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A numeric matrix with 240 rows corresponding to target nouns denoting goods and 4 columns, corresponding to
</p>

<dl>
<dt>
<code>own</code>, <code>buy</code>, <code>sell</code>:</dt>
<dd>
<p>association scores for co-occurrences of the nouns with the verbs <em>own</em>, <em>buy</em> and <em>sell</em>
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>fringe</code>:</dt>
<dd>
<p>an indicator of how close each point is to the “fringe” of the data set (ranging from 0 to 1)
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Co-occurrence data are based on verb-object dependency relations in the British National Corpus, obtained from <code>DSM_VerbNounTriples_BNC</code>.  Only nouns that co-occur with all three verbs are included in the data set.
</p>
<p>The co-occurrence matrix is weighted with <em>non-sparse</em> log-likelihood (<code>simple-ll</code>) and an additional logarithmic transformation (<code>log</code>).  Row vectors are <em>not</em> normalized.
</p>
<p>The <em>fringeness score</em> in column <code>fringe</code> indicates how close a data point is to the fringe of the data set.  Values are distance quantiles based on PCA-whitened Manhattan distance from the centroid.  For example, <code>fringe &gt;= .8</code> characterizes 20% of points that are closest to the fringe.  Fringeness is mainly used to select points to be labelled in plots or to take stratified samples from the data set.

<h2>Cox-Stuart test for trend analysis
The Cox-Stuart test is defined as a little powerful test (power equal to 0.78), but very robust for the trend analysis.
It is therefore applicable to a wide variety of situations, to get an idea of the evolution of values obtained.
The proposed method is based on the binomial distribution.

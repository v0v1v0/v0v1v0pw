<h2>Calculates  anomalies</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Function to calculate short-, medium-, and long-term hydrologic anomalies
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">compAnom(dataset, which = 1)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dataset</code></td>
<td>
<p>is the daily hydrologic data returned from importDVs 
or data otherwise obtained and in the same format as that produced by 
importDVs.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>which</code></td>
<td>
<p>indicates which set of anomalies; 1 calculates the 1-year, 
30-day, and 1-day anomalies; 2 calculates the 100-day, 10-day, and 1-day 
anomalies; 3 calculates the 30-day and 1-day anomalies; and 4 calculates 
the 10-year, 5-year, 1-year, one-quarter-year (seasonal), and 1-day 
anomalies.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function was written with streamflow data in mind because streamflow 
is the most commonly used exogenous variable for trend models for water 
quality;  however, the function is generic so that users may experiment with 
anomalies from other daily hydrologic data.  Examples of the inclusion of 
streamflow anomalies in trend analysis of nutrients, pesticides and 
surface water can be found in Alexander and Smith (2006), Ryberg and Vecchia 
(2006), Ryberg and others (2010), Sullivan and others (2009), Vecchia
(2003), Vecchia (2005), and Vecchia and others (2008).

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list.  In the cases of "which" equal to 1 or 2, the 
first element of the list is a data frame containing the station 
identification number, dates, streamflow, and long-term, mid-term, and 
short-term anomalies.  The next three elements of the list are the length 
in days of the long-term, mid-term, and short-term streamflow anomalies.  
In the case of "which" equal to 3, the first element of the list is a data 
frame containing the station identification number, dates, streamflow, and 
mid-term and short-term anomalies.  The next two elements of the list are 
the length in days of the mid-term and short-term streamflow anomalies.  
In the case of "which" equal to 4, the first element of the list is a data 
frame containing the station identification number, dates, streamflow, and 
10-year, 5-year, annual, seasonal, and daily streamflow anomalies.  The 
next five elements of the list are the length in days of the 10-year, 
5-year, annual, seasonal, and daily streamflow anomalies.

<h2>Determination of the square of the "Critical Correlation Coefficient" (CCC2).</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Abernethy has promoted the 10th percentile of Correlation Coefficients generated by pivotal Monte Carlo analysis as a critical measure by which a fit should be designated suitable for further analysis.  According to his practice, the difference between the square of the Correlation Coefficient and the CCC2 (R^2 - CCC^2) is used to make comparitive judgments between weibull and lognormal fitting on the same data.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">getCCC2(F, model="weibull") 
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>F</code></td>
<td>
<p>The quantity of complete failure data points under consideration.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>model</code></td>
<td>
<p>A string defining the distribution under consideration. Only a value of "lnorm" will be treated any differently from default of "weibull".</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The value returned is derived from a correlation developed from previously run pivotal analysis with 10^8 random samples.  Project "Abernethy Reliability Methods" has judged that only the CCC^2 derived from 2 parameter models to have usefullness in such analysis.  This is seen from the "Detect Power" presentations in Appendix D of "The New Weibull Handbook, Fifth Edition".  For validity of a 3rd parameter optimization on a given model over its 2 parameter fit, only the Likelihood Ratio Test will be applied.  This validity check requires an LRT-P greater than 50
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a single valued vector for the square of CCC (for comparison with R squared).

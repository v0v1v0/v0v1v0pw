<h2>Effect size calculatator based on raw data for Cluster Randomized Trials with 3 Arms</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function is for effect size and ICC calculation for Cluster randomized trials (CRT) with 3 arms based on empirical data.
CRT are a type of multilevel design for the situation when the entire cluster is randomly assigned to either a treatment arm or a contral arm <cite>(Liu, 2013)</cite>.
The data from CRT can be analyzed in a two-level hierachical linear model, where the indicator variable for treatment assignment is included in second level. If a study contains multiple treatments, then mutiple indicators will be used.
This function is for designs with 3 arms (i.e., two treatments and a control).
Details leading to power calculation can be found in <cite>Raudenbush (1997)</cite> and <cite>Liu (2013)</cite>.
The Effect size f specifies the main effect of treatment, the mean difference between the treatment clusters and the control clusters.
This function is used to calculate the effect size with a input data set.

<h2>HFAII Queen Hemisphere Adjacency Matrix</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Binary adjacency matrix for the Humphrey Field Analyzer-II (Carl Zeiss Meditec Inc., Dublin, CA)
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(HFAII_QueenHF)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>This adjacency matrix is formated using queen neighbor criteria, meaning two locations on
the visual field are only considered neighbors if they share an edge or corner. An additional criterion
is included that locations are not considered neighbors if they fall within different hemispheres on the
visual field. The adjacency matrix is a 54 x 54 dimensional binary object with zeros on the diagonal and
the column and row sums are equal to the number of neighbors.

<h2>threecity data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Extracted data from a french population based cohort (Three-City cohort). The dataset includes 
followup information on dementia outcome and predicted 5-year risks based on 
based on the subject specific information which includes age, gender,
education level and cognitive decline measured by a psychometric test
(Mini Mental State Examination). The prediction model from which the
predictions have been computed has been fitted on independent training
data from the Paquid cohort, another french population based cohort with similar design (see Reference Blanche et al. 2015 for details) .

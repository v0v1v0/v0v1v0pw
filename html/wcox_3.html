<h2>Prepare data for weight calculation using the population incidence.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function prepares the sample data for weight calculation using external information, i.e. the incidence in the population.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">Prepare_data(dat, population_incidence, breaks)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dat</code></td>
<td>
<p>Data.frame with one row per individual which at least includes a column <strong>d</strong> with event indicator (1 for event, 0 for censored), a column <strong>y</strong> with event/censoring time.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>population_incidence</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector (in combination with breaks) or a data.frame (columns 1) 'start age group', 2) 'end age group', 3)'S_pop') with population incidence per 100,000 per interval k.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>breaks</code></td>
<td>
<p>Cut-points for the (age/time) groups. Only needed when population_incidence is a vector.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Weights are based on a comparison between the survival between sample and
population. Therefore, besides the sample data, the population incidence rate
(per 100 000) is needed as input, as well as the cut-offs of the
(age/time-to-event) groups for which this is available, unless this is provided in a data.frame.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Data.frame ready for weight calculation using function 'Calculate_weights()': one row per individual and a.o. columns <strong>id</strong> unique ID; <strong>d</strong> non-censoring indicator; <strong>k</strong> interval of (age) group; <strong>S_k</strong> population interval-based proportion of individuals experiencing the event in intervals later than k; <strong>S_k.</strong> sample proportion of individuals experiencing the event in intervals later than k.

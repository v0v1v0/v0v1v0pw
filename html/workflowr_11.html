<h2>Convert to a workflowr HTML document</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Workflowr custom format for converting from R Markdown to an HTML document.
<code>wflow_html</code> has two distinct functionalities: 1) configure the
formatting of the HTML by extending <code>html_document</code>
(see the
<a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html">RStudio
documentation</a> for the available options), and 2) configure the workflowr
reproducibility features (typically specified in a file named
<code>_workflowr.yml</code>). <code>wflow_html</code> is intended to be used to generate
webpages for a workflowr website, but it can also be used outside a workflowr
project to implement reproducibility features for single R Markdown documents.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">wflow_html(...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Arguments passed to <code>html_document</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An <code>output_format</code> object to pass to
<code>render</code>.
</p>


<h3>HTML formatting</h3>

<p><code>wflow_html</code> extends
<code>html_document</code>. To set default formatting options to
be shared across all of your HTML files, set them in the file
<code>analysis/_site.yml</code>. This special file can also be used to configure
other aspects of the website like the navigation bar (for more details see
the documentation on
<a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rmarkdown-site.html">R Markdown
websites</a>). For example, to use the theme "cosmo" and add a table of contents
to every webpage, you would add the following to <code>analysis/_site.yml</code>:
</p>
<pre>
output:
  workflowr::wflow_html:
    toc: true
    theme: cosmo
</pre>
<p>Formatting options can also be set for a specific file, which will override
the default options set in <code>analysis/_site.yml</code>. For example, to remove
the table of contents from one specific file, you would add the following to
the YAML header of that file:
</p>
<pre>
output:
  workflowr::wflow_html:
    toc: false
</pre>
<p>However, this will preserve any of the other shared options (e.g. the theme
in the above example). If you are not overriding any of the shared options,
it is not necessary to specify <code>wflow_html</code> in the YAML header of your
workflowr R Markdown files.
</p>


<h3>Reproducibility features</h3>

<p><code>wflow_html</code> also implements the workflowr reproducibility features. For
example, it automatically sets a seed with <code>set.seed</code>; inserts
the current code version (i.e. Git commit ID); runs <code>sessionInfo</code>
at the end of the document; and inserts links to past versions of the file
and figures.
</p>
<p>These reproducibility options are not passed directly as arguments to
<code>wflow_html</code>. Instead these options are specified in
<code>_workflowr.yml</code> or in the YAML header of an R Markdown file (using the
field <code>workflowr:</code>). These options (along with their default values) are
as follows:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>knit_root_dir</dt>
<dd>
<p>The directory where code inside an R Markdown file is
executed; this ultimately sets argument <code>knit_root_dir</code> in
<code>render</code>. By default, <code>wflow_start</code> sets
<code>knit_root_dir</code> in the file <code>_workflowr.yml</code> to be the path
<code>"."</code>. This path is a
<a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/reference.html#relative-path">relative
path</a> from the location of <code>_workflowr.yml</code> to the directory for the
code to be executed. The path <code>"."</code> is shorthand for "current working
directory", and thus code is executed in the root of the workflowr project.
You can change this to be a relative path to any subdirectory of your
project. Also, if you were to delete this line from <code>_workflowr.yml</code>,
then this would cause the code to be executed from the same directory in
which the R Markdown files are located (i.e. <code>analysis/</code> in the
default workflowr setup).
</p>
<p>It is also possible (though in general not recommended) to configure the
<code>knit_root_dir</code> to apply to only one of the R Markdown files by
specifying it in the YAML header of that particular file. In this case, the
supplied path is interpreted as relative to the R Markdown file itself.
Thus <code>knit_root_dir: "../data"</code> would execute the code in the
subdirectory <code>data/</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>seed</dt>
<dd>
<p>The <code>seed</code> argument in the call to <code>set.seed</code>,
which is added to the beginning of an R Markdown file. In
<code>wflow_start</code>, this is set to the date using the format
<code>YYYYMMDD</code>. If no seed is specified, the default is <code>12345</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>sessioninfo</dt>
<dd>
<p>The function that is run to record the session
information. The default is <code>"sessionInfo()"</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>github</dt>
<dd>
<p>The URL of the remote repository for creating links to past
results. If unspecified, the URL is guessed from the "git remote" settings
(see <code>wflow_git_remote</code>). Specifying this setting inside
<code>_workflowr.yml</code> is especially helpful if multiple users are
collaborating on a project since it ensures that everyone generates the
same URLs.</p>
</dd>
<dt>suppress_report</dt>
<dd>
<p>By default a workflowr report is inserted at the top
of every HTML file containing useful summaries of the reproducibility
features and links to past versions of the analysis. To suppress this
report, set <code>suppress_report</code> to <code>TRUE</code></p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>.

</p>
<p>In the default workflowr setup, the file <code>_workflowr.yml</code> is located in
the root of the project. For most users it is best to leave it there, but if
you are interested in experimenting with the directory layout, the
<code>_workflowr.yml</code> file can be located in the same directory as the R
Markdown files or in any directory upstream of that directory.
</p>
<p>Here is an example of a customized <code>_workflowr.yml</code> file:
</p>
<pre>
# Execute code in project directory
knit_root_dir: "."
# Set a custom seed
seed: 4815162342
# Use sessioninfo package to generate the session information.
sessioninfo: "sessioninfo::session_info()"
# Use this URL when inserting links to past results.
github: https://github.com/repoowner/mainrepo
</pre>
<p>And here is an example of a YAML header inside an R Markdown file with the
same exact custom settings as above:
</p>
<pre>
---
title: "About"
output:
  workflowr::wflow_html:
    toc: false
workflowr:
  knit_root_dir: ".."
  seed: 4815162342
  sessioninfo: "sessioninfo::session_info()"
  github: https://github.com/repoowner/mainrepo
---
</pre>
<p>Note that the path passed to <code>knit_root_dir</code> changed to <code>".."</code>
because it is relative to the R Markdown file instead of
<code>_workflowr.yml</code>. Both have the effect of having the code executed in
the root of the workflowr project.

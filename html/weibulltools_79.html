<h2>weibulltools</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Provides statistical methods and visualizations that are often used in
reliability engineering. Comprises a compact and easily accessible set of
methods and visualization tools that make the examination and adjustment as
well as the analysis and interpretation of field data (and bench tests) as
simple as possible.
</p>
<p>Besides the well-known Weibull analysis, the package supports multiple
lifetime distributions and also contains Monte Carlo methods for the
correction and completion of imprecisely recorded or unknown lifetime
characteristics.
</p>
<p>Plots are created statically
(<code>ggplot2</code>) or
interactively (<code>plotly</code>) and can be
customized with functions of the respective visualization package.

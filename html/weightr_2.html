<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The General Aptitude Test Battery (GATB) is designed to measure nine
cognitive, perceptual, and psychomotor skills thought relevant to the prediction
of job performance. From 1947 to 1993, a total of 755 studies were completed in
order to assess the validity of the GATB and its nine scales, and the GATB has
been found to be a moderately valid predictor of job performance. This dataset
consists of validity coefficients for the General Ability scale of the GATB.

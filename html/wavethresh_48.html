<h2>Calls C code to threshold wd class object.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A routine that calls a C code function to do thresholding. This is really a test routine to call a C thresholding function (Cthreshold) and the user is advised to use the R based generic thresholding function
<code>threshold</code> and/or its methods as they contain a wider range of thresholding options.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">Cthreshold(wd, thresh.type = "soft", value = 0, levels = 3:(nlevelsWT(wd) - 1)) 
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>wd</code></td>
<td>
<p>The wavelet object that you wish to threshold.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>thresh.type</code></td>
<td>
<p>The type of thresholding. This can be "soft" or "hard". See <code>threshold</code> and methods for further details.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>value</code></td>
<td>
<p>The threshold value that you want to be used (e.g. for hard thresholding wavelet coefficients whose absolute value is less than</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>levels</code></td>
<td>
<p>The resolution levels that you wish to compute the threshold on and apply the threshold to.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For general use it is recommended to use the
<code>threshold</code> functions as they have a wider variety of options
and also work for more complex varieties of wavelet transforms
(i.e. non-decimated, complex-valued, etc).
However, in the right, limited, situation this function can be useful.
This function directly calls the C thresholding function Cthreshold().
The C function is used by routines that operate on behalf of the function
that carries out two-fold cross validation in C (<code>CWCV</code>) which
is also accessible using the <code>policy="cv"</code> option too
<code>threshold.wd</code>
</p>
<p>This function can be used by the user. It might be a bit faster than
<code>threshold.wd</code> but mostly because it is simpler and does less checking than
<code>threshold.wd</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A <code>wd.object</code> class object, but containing thresholded coefficients.

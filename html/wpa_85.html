<h2>Compute a Flexibility Index based on the Hourly Collaboration Query</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><a href="https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental"><img src="../help/figures/lifecycle-experimental.svg" alt="[Experimental]"></a>
</p>
<p>Pass an Hourly Collaboration query and compute a Flexibility Index for the
entire population. The Flexibility Index is a quantitative measure of the
freedom for employees to work at a time of their choice.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">flex_index(
  data,
  hrvar = NULL,
  signals = c("email", "IM"),
  active_threshold = 0,
  start_hour = "0900",
  end_hour = "1700",
  return = "plot",
  plot_method = "common",
  mode = "binary"
)

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <strong>Flexibility Index</strong> is a metric that has been developed to quantify and
measure flexibility using behavioural data from Viva Insights. Flexibility
here refers to the freedom of employees to adopt a working arrangement of
their own choice, and more specifically refers to <strong>time</strong> flexibility
(<em>whenever</em> I want) as opposed to <strong>geographical</strong> flexibility (<em>wherever</em> I
want).
</p>
<p>The <strong>Flexibility Index</strong> is a score between 0 and 1, and is calculated based
on three component measures:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>ChangeHours</code>: this represents the freedom to define work start and end
time. Teams that embrace flexibility allow members to start and end their
workday at different times.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>TakeBreaks</code>: this represents the freedom define one's own schedule. In
teams that embrace flexibility, some members will choose to organize / split
their day in different ways (e.g. take a long lunch-break, disconnect in the
afternoon and reconnect in the evening, etc.).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>ControlHours</code>: this represents the freedom to switch off. Members who
choose alternative arrangements should be able to maintain a workload that is
broadly equivalent to those that follow standard arrangements.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>Flexibility Index</strong> returns with one single score for each person-week,
plus the <strong>three</strong> sub-component binary variables (<code>TakeBreaks</code>,
<code>ChangeHours</code>, <code>ControlHours</code>). At the person-week level, each score can only
have the values 0, 0.33, 0.66, and 1. The Flexibility Index should only be
interpreted as a <strong>group</strong> of person-weeks, e.g. the average Flexibility
Index of a team of 6 over time, where the possible values would range from 0
to 1.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A different output is returned depending on the value passed to the <code>return</code>
argument:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>"plot"</code>: 'ggplot' object. A random of ten working patterns are displayed,
with diagnostic data and the Flexibility Index shown on the plot.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>"data"</code>: data frame. The original input data appended with the
Flexibility Index and the component scores. Can be used with
<code>plot_flex_index()</code> to recreate visuals found in <code>flex_index()</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>"table"</code>: data frame. A summary table for the metric.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Context</h3>

<p>The central feature of flexible working arrangements is
that it is the employee rather the employer who chooses the working
arrangement. <em>Observed flexibility</em> serves as a proxy to assess whether a
flexible working arrangement are in place. The Flexibility Index is an
attempt to create such a proxy for quantifying and measuring flexibility,
using behavioural data from Viva Insights.
</p>


<h3>Recurring disconnection time</h3>

<p>The key component of <code>TakeBreaks</code> in the Flexibility Index is best
interpreted as 'recurring disconnection time'. This denotes an hourly block
where there is consistently no activity occurring throughout the week. Note
that this applies a stricter criterion compared to the common definition of
a break, which is simply a time interval where no active work is being
done, and thus the more specific terminology 'recurring disconnection time'
is preferred.
</p>


<h3>Returning the raw data</h3>

<p>The raw data containing the computed Flexibility Index can be returned with
the following:
</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre>em_data %&gt;%
  flex_index(return = "data")
</pre></div>

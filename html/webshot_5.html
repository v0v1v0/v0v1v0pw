<h2>Install PhantomJS</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Download the zip package, unzip it, and copy the executable to a system
directory in which <span class="pkg">webshot</span> can look for the PhantomJS executable.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">install_phantomjs(
  version = "2.1.1",
  baseURL = "https://github.com/wch/webshot/releases/download/v0.3.1/",
  force = FALSE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>version</code></td>
<td>
<p>The version number of PhantomJS.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>baseURL</code></td>
<td>
<p>The base URL for the location of PhantomJS binaries for
download. If the default download site is unavailable, you may specify an
alternative mirror, such as
<code>"https://bitbucket.org/ariya/phantomjs/downloads/"</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>force</code></td>
<td>
<p>Install PhantomJS even if the version installed is the latest or
if the requested version is older. This is useful to reinstall or downgrade
the version of PhantomJS.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function was designed primarily to help Windows users since it
is cumbersome to modify the <code>PATH</code> variable. Mac OS X users may
install PhantomJS via Homebrew. If you download the package from the
PhantomJS website instead, please make sure the executable can be found via
the <code>PATH</code> variable.
</p>
<p>On Windows, the directory specified by the environment variable
<code>APPDATA</code> is used to store ‘<span class="file">phantomjs.exe</span>’. On OS X, the
directory ‘<span class="file">~/Library/Application Support</span>’ is used. On other platforms
(such as Linux), the directory ‘<span class="file">~/bin</span>’ is used. If these directories
are not writable, the directory ‘<span class="file">PhantomJS</span>’ under the installation
directory of the <span class="pkg">webshot</span> package will be tried. If this directory
still fails, you will have to install PhantomJS by yourself.
</p>
<p>If PhantomJS is not already installed on the computer, this function will
attempt to install it. However, if the version of PhantomJS installed is
greater than or equal to the requested version, this function will not
perform the installation procedure again unless the <code>force</code> parameter
is set to <code>TRUE</code>. As a result, this function may also be used to
reinstall or downgrade the version of PhantomJS found.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>NULL</code> (the executable is written to a system directory).

<h2>Disambiguate QIDs</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Interactive function that presents alternative possible QID matches for a list of text
strings and provides options for choosing between alternatives, rejecting all presented alternatives,
or creating new items. Useful in cases where a list of text strings may have either missing wikidata items
or multiple alternative potential matches that need to be manually disambuguated. Can also used on
lists of lists (see examples). For long lists of items, the process can be stopped partway through and
the returned vector will indicate where the process was stopped.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">disambiguate_QIDs(
  list,
  variablename = "variables",
  variableinfo = NULL,
  filter_property = NULL,
  filter_variable = NULL,
  filter_firsthit = FALSE,
  limit = 10
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>list</code></td>
<td>
<p>a list or vector of text strings to find potential QID matches to.
Can also be a list of lists (see examples)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>variablename</code></td>
<td>
<p>type of items in the list that are being disambiguated (used in messages)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>variableinfo</code></td>
<td>
<p>additional information about items that are being disambiguated (used in messages)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>filter_property</code></td>
<td>
<p>property to filter on (e.g. "P31" to filter on "instance of")</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>filter_variable</code></td>
<td>
<p>values of that property to use to filter out (e.g. "Q571" to filter out books)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>filter_firsthit</code></td>
<td>
<p>apply filter to the first match presented or only if alternatives requested?
(default = FALSE, note: true is slower if filter not needed on most matches)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>limit</code></td>
<td>
<p>number of alternative possible wikidata items to present if multiple potential matches</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a vector of:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>QID</dt>
<dd>
<p>Selected QID (for when an appropriate Wikidata match exists)</p>
</dd>
<dt>CREATE</dt>
<dd>
<p>Mark that a new Wikidata item should be created (for when no appropriate Wikidata match yet exists)</p>
</dd>
<dt>NA</dt>
<dd>
<p>Mark that no Wikidata item is needed</p>
</dd>
<dt>STOP</dt>
<dd>
<p>Mark that the process was halted at this point (so that output can be used as input to the function later)</p>
</dd>
</dl>

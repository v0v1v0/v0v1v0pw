<h2>Effect size calculatator based on raw data for Multisite Randomized Trials with 2 Arms</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function is for effect size calculation for Multisite randomized trials (MRT) with 2 arms based on empirical data.
MRTs are a type of multilevel design for the situation when the entire cluster is randomly assigned to either a treatment arm or a contral arm <cite>(Liu, 2013)</cite>.
The data from MRT can be analyzed in a two-level hierachical linear model, where the indicator variable for treatment assignment is included in first level. If a study contains multiple treatments, then mutiple indicators will be used.
Three types of tests are considered in the function: (1) The "main" type tests treatment main effect;
(2) The "site" type tests the variance of cluster/site means;
and (3) The "variance" type tests variance of treatment effects.
Details leading to power calculation can be found in <cite>Raudenbush (1997)</cite> and <cite>Liu (2013)</cite>.
This function is used to calculate the effect size with a input data set.

<h2>Generate Balancing Weights for Longitudinal Treatments</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>weightitMSM()</code> allows for the easy generation of balancing weights for
marginal structural models for time-varying treatments using a variety of
available methods for binary, continuous, and multi-category treatments. Many
of these methods exist in other packages, which <code>weightit()</code> calls; these
packages must be installed to use the desired method.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">weightitMSM(
  formula.list,
  data = NULL,
  method = "glm",
  stabilize = FALSE,
  by = NULL,
  s.weights = NULL,
  num.formula = NULL,
  moments = NULL,
  int = FALSE,
  missing = NULL,
  verbose = FALSE,
  include.obj = FALSE,
  keep.mparts = TRUE,
  is.MSM.method,
  weightit.force = FALSE,
  ...
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>formula.list</code></td>
<td>
<p>a list of formulas corresponding to each time point with
the time-specific treatment variable on the left hand side and pre-treatment
covariates to be balanced on the right hand side. The formulas must be in
temporal order, and must contain all covariates to be balanced at that time
point (i.e., treatments and covariates featured in early formulas should
appear in later ones). Interactions and functions of covariates are allowed.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>an optional data set in the form of a data frame that contains
the variables in the formulas in <code>formula.list</code>. This must be a wide
data set with exactly one row per unit.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p>a string of length 1 containing the name of the method that
will be used to estimate weights. See <code>weightit()</code> for allowable options.
The default is <code>"glm"</code>, which estimates the weights using generalized
linear models.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>stabilize</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>logical</code>; whether or not to stabilize the weights.
Stabilizing the weights involves fitting a model predicting treatment at
each time point from treatment status at prior time points. If <code>TRUE</code>,
a fully saturated model will be fit (i.e., all interactions between all
treatments up to each time point), essentially using the observed treatment
probabilities in the numerator (for binary and multi-category treatments). This
may yield an error if some combinations are not observed. Default is
<code>FALSE</code>. To manually specify stabilization model formulas, e.g., to
specify non-saturated models, use <code>num.formula</code>. With many time points,
saturated models may be time-consuming or impossible to fit.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>by</code></td>
<td>
<p>a string containing the name of the variable in <code>data</code> for
which weighting is to be done within categories or a one-sided formula with
the stratifying variable on the right-hand side. For example, if <code>by = "gender"</code> or <code>by = ~gender</code>, a separate propensity score model or optimization will occur within each level of the variable <code>"gender"</code>. Only one
<code>by</code> variable is allowed; to stratify by multiply variables
simultaneously, create a new variable that is a full cross of those
variables using <code>interaction()</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>s.weights</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of sampling weights or the name of a variable in
<code>data</code> that contains sampling weights. These can also be matching
weights if weighting is to be used on matched data. See the individual pages
for each method for information on whether sampling weights can be supplied.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>num.formula</code></td>
<td>
<p>optional; a one-sided formula with the stabilization
factors (other than the previous treatments) on the right hand side, which
adds, for each time point, the stabilization factors to a model saturated
with previous treatments. See Cole &amp; Hern√°n (2008) for a discussion of how
to specify this model; including stabilization factors can change the
estimand without proper adjustment, and should be done with caution. Can
also be a list of one-sided formulas, one for each time point. Unless you
know what you are doing, we recommend setting <code>stabilize = TRUE</code> and
ignoring <code>num.formula</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>moments</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>numeric</code>; for some methods, the greatest power of each
covariate to be balanced. For example, if <code>moments = 3</code>, for each
non-categorical covariate, the covariate, its square, and its cube will be
balanced. This argument is ignored for other methods; to balance powers of
the covariates, appropriate functions must be entered in <code>formula</code>. See
the individual pages for each method for information on whether they accept
<code>moments</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>int</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>logical</code>; for some methods, whether first-order
interactions of the covariates are to be balanced. This argument is ignored
for other methods; to balance interactions between the variables,
appropriate functions must be entered in <code>formula</code>. See the individual
pages for each method for information on whether they accept <code>int</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>missing</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>character</code>; how missing data should be handled. The
options and defaults depend on the <code>method</code> used. Ignored if no missing
data is present. It should be noted that multiple imputation outperforms all
available missingness methods available in <code>weightit()</code> and should
probably be used instead. Consider the <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=MatchThem"><span class="pkg">MatchThem</span></a>
package for the use of <code>weightit()</code> with multiply imputed data.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>logical</code>; whether to print additional information
output by the fitting function.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>include.obj</code></td>
<td>
<p>whether to include in the output a list of the fit
objects created in the process of estimating the weights at each time point.
For example, with <code>method = "glm"</code>, a list of the <code>glm</code> objects
containing the propensity score models at each time point will be included.
See the help pages for each method for information on what object will be
included if <code>TRUE</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>keep.mparts</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>logical</code>; whether to include in the output components necessary to estimate standard errors that account for estimation of the weights in <code>glm_weightit()</code>. Default is <code>TRUE</code> if such parts are present. See the individual pages for each method for whether these components are produced. Set to <code>FALSE</code> to keep the output object smaller, e.g., if standard errors will not be computed using <code>glm_weightit()</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>is.MSM.method</code></td>
<td>
<p>whether the method estimates weights for multiple time
points all at once (<code>TRUE</code>) or by estimating weights at each time point
and then multiplying them together (<code>FALSE</code>). This is only relevant for user-specified functions.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>weightit.force</code></td>
<td>
<p>several methods are not valid for estimating weights
with longitudinal treatments, and will produce an error message if
attempted. Set to <code>TRUE</code> to bypass this error message.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>other arguments for functions called by <code>weightit()</code> that
control aspects of fitting that are not covered by the above arguments. See
Details at <code>weightit()</code>.</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Currently only "wide" data sets, where each row corresponds to a unit's
entire variable history, are supported. You can use <code>reshape()</code> or other
functions to transform your data into this format; see example below.
</p>
<p>In general, <code>weightitMSM()</code> works by separating the estimation of
weights into separate procedures for each time period based on the formulas
provided. For each formula, <code>weightitMSM()</code> simply calls
<code>weightit()</code> to that formula, collects the weights for each time
period, and multiplies them together to arrive at longitudinal balancing
weights.
</p>
<p>Each formula should contain all the covariates to be balanced on. For
example, the formula corresponding to the second time period should contain
all the baseline covariates, the treatment variable at the first time
period, and the time-varying covariates that took on values after the first
treatment and before the second. Currently, only wide data sets are
supported, where each unit is represented by exactly one row that contains
the covariate and treatment history encoded in separate variables.
</p>
<p>The <code>"cbps"</code> method, which calls <code>CBPS()</code> in <span class="pkg">CBPS</span>, will
yield different results from <code>CBMSM()</code> in <span class="pkg">CBPS</span> because
<code>CBMSM()</code> takes a different approach to generating weights than simply
estimating several time-specific models.

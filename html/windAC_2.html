<h2>Carcass distance example data set</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Example data set of carcass distance found during searches under wind turbines.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(carcassDistance)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 56 rows and 6 variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>season</dt>
<dd>
<p>The season in which that carcass was found.</p>
</dd>
<dt>plotType</dt>
<dd>
<p>The plot type (either FULL or RP) that was being searched when the carcass was found.</p>
</dd>
<dt>proportionTurbineType</dt>
<dd>
<p> The proportion of turbines that have that plot type. For <code>plotType=FULL</code> the value is 0.1 and 0.9 for <code>plotType=RP</code></p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>.
</p>
<dl>
<dt>distanceFromTurbine</dt>
<dd>
<p> Meters, carcass distance from the turbine.</p>
</dd>
<dt>compassBearingDegree</dt>
<dd>
<p>Degrees, the compass bearing from the turbine to the carcass location. Zero degrees is north, 90 degrees is east, etc.</p>
</dd>
<dt>probabilityDetection</dt>
<dd>
<p>The summarized probability of detection from the bias trial information.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The fictitious wind farm has 100 turbines.
For 90 turbines the search plot consists of the turbine pad and the road out to 100 meters (RP = road and pad).
The remaining 10 turbines had full plots (FULL) that are circular with a radius of 100 meters.
The wind farm was searched during two seasons: Spring and Fall.
</p>
<p>The example carcasses are all the same size class (bats).
</p>
<p>Bias trials are also done to account for searcher efficiency and carcass removal.
These results are summarized as a probability of detection in the data set.

<h2>Known events which happened on October 1st before 9am</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The Water Year in the UK runs from 9am of the 1st October of a given year
to 8:59am of the 1st October of the next year. Since the WINFAP files contain
information only on the date of the annual maximum (and not time) it is possible that an event is
mis-classified when using the <code>water_year</code> function. This dataset lists the events which are
known to have happened to October 1st before 9am. This is used to correct the <code>WaterYear</code>
information in these known cases in the <code>read_amax</code> and <code>get_amax</code> functions. For some stations
events on October 1st have been deemed as annual maxima only in some winfap releases. They are
maintained in the dataset in the event that somebody read old winfap files.

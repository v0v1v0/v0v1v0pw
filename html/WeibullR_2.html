<h2>Determination of the percentile of r and r-squared, by correlation.  Here designated "Abernethy's P-value"</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The percentile of r and r-squared (prr) generated by pivotal Monte Carlo analysis has been promoted as a goodness of fit measure by Robert B. Abernethy. 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">AbPval(F,R2,model="weibull")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>F</code></td>
<td>
<p>The quantity of complete failure data points under consideration.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>R2</code></td>
<td>
<p>The square of the correlation coefficient derived from residuals of the linear model.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>model</code></td>
<td>
<p>A string defining the distribution under consideration. Only entry of "lnorm", or "lognormal" will alter the default of "weibull".</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The value returned is derived from a correlation developed from previously run pivotal analysis with 10^8 random samples.  Only the prr derived from 2 parameter models is judged to have usefullness in comparitive analysis. For validity of a 3rd parameter optimization on a given model over its 2 parameter fit, only the Likelihood Ratio Test should be considered.  
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a vector containing the  P-value and the square of CCC (for comparison with R squared).

<h2>Physiological data time series.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Two linked medical time series containing 2048 observations sampled every 16 seconds recorded from 21:17:59 to 06:27:18. Both these time series were recorded from the same 66 day old infant by Prof. Peter Fleming, Dr Andrew Sawczenko and Jeanine Young of the Institute of Child Health, Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Bristol. <code>BabyECG</code>, is a record of the infant's heart rate (in beats per minute). BabySS is a record of the infant's sleep state on a scale of 1 to 4 as determined by a trained expert monitoring EEG (brain) and EOG (eye-movement). The sleep state codes are 1=quiet sleep, 2=between quiet and active sleep, 3=active sleep, 4=awake.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>The <code>BabyECG</code> time series is a nice examples of a non-stationary time series whose spectral (time-scale) properties vary over time. The function <code>ewspec</code> can be used to anaylse this time series to inspect the variation in the power of the series over time and scales. 
</p>
<p>The <code>BabySS</code> time series is a useful independent time series that can be associated with changing power in the <code>BabyECG</code> series. See the discussion in Nason, von Sachs and Kroisandt.

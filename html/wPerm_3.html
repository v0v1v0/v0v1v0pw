<h3>Details</h3>


<p>One year at Arizona State University, the algebra course director
decided to experiment with a new teaching method that might reduce
variability in final-exam scores by eliminating lower scores. The
director randomly divided the algebra students who were registered
for class at 9:40 A.M. into two groups. One of the groups, called
the <em>control group</em>, was taught the usual algebra course; the other
group, called the <em>experimental group</em>, was taught by the new teaching
method. Both classes covered the same material, took the same unit
quizzes, and took the same final exam at the same time. The final-exam
scores (out of 40 possible) for the students in the control group
are provided in the control dataset.

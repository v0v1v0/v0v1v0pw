<code>game$guess_count</code>) against the target word in <code>game$target</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">

<td>
<p>'wordler' game object (as generated by
<code>new_wordler</code>).</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Adds the assessment to the corresponding list item in <code>game$assess</code>.
This assessment should be considered as how the guesses should be displayed
to the user and replicates the behaviour of the WORDLE game
(<a href="https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/">https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/</a>).
</p>
<p>For each letter in each guess, one of the following assessments are made:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> 'not_in_word' - the letter is not present in the target word (or has
already been flagged as 'in_word' earlier in the word).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> 'in_word' - the letter is in the target word. More specifically,
the first instance of the letter in the guess present in the word.
Subsequent instances are flagged as 'not_in_word'.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> 'in_position' - the letter is in the same position in the target
word.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

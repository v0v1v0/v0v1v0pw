<h2>
<em>Wallace</em>: A modular platform for reproducible ecological modeling</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><em>Wallace</em> is a <code>shiny</code> app that guides users through a complete
species niche/distributional modeling analysis, from the acquisition of
species occurrence and environmental data to visualizing model predictions
on an interactive map (<code>rleaflet</code>), thus bundling complex workflows
into a single, streamlined GUI interface. New functionality, in the form of
modules, can be added to <em>Wallace</em> via contributions from the user
community. In addition, executable session code (R Markdown format) can
be downloaded to share with others or use as supplementary information
for scientific papers and reports. The application is run via the
function <code>run_wallace</code>.

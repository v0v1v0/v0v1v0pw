<h2>Phenological amplitude</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Finds various measures of the amplitude of the annual cycle, or of some
specified season range.
</p>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A seasonal time series, or a class <code>zoo</code> object.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>season.range</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of two numbers specifying the season range to
be considered.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>phenoAmp</code> gives three measures of the amplitude of a seasonal cycle:
the range, the variance, and the median absolute deviation, along with the
mean and median to allow calculation of other statistics as well.
</p>
<p>These measures can be restricted to a subset of the year by giving the
desired range of season numbers. This can be useful for isolating measures
of, say, the spring and autumn phytoplankton blooms in temperate waters. In
the case of a monthly time series, for example, a non-missing value is
required for every month or the result will be <code>NA</code>, so using a period
shorter than one year can also help avoid any months that are typically not
covered by the sampling program. Similarly, in the case of dated
observations, a shorter period can help avoid times of sparse data. The
method for time series allows for other than monthly frequencies, but
<code>season.range</code> is always interpreted as months for <code>zoo</code> objects.
</p>
<p>Note that the amplitude is sensitive to the number of samples for small
numbers. This could be a problem for <code>zoo</code> objects if the sample number
is changing greatly from year to year, depending on the amplitude measure
and the underlying data distribution. So use <code>ts</code> objects or make sure
that the sample number stays more or less the same over time.
</p>
<p><code>tsMake</code> can be used to produce <code>ts</code> and <code>zoo</code> objects
suitable as arguments to this function.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A matrix of class <code>ts</code> or <code>zoo</code> with individual series for
the range, variance, median absolute deviation, mean, median and – in the
case of <code>zoo</code> objects – number of samples.

<h2>read Squid files</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>the Squid default log formats are either the CLF - for which, use
<code>read_clf</code> - or the "native" Squid format, which is described in more detail
below. <code>read_squid</code> allows you to read the latter.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">read_squid(file, has_header = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>file</code></td>
<td>
<p>the full path to the CLF-formatted file you want to read.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>has_header</code></td>
<td>
<p>whether or not the file has a header row. Set to FALSE by
default.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The log format for Squid servers can be custom-set, but by default follows one of two
patterns; it's either the Common Log Format (CLF), which you can read in with
<code>read_clf</code>, or the "native log format", a Squid-specific format handled
by this function. It consists of the fields:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>timestamp: the timestamp identifying when the request was received. This is
stored (from the file's point of view) as a count of seconds, in UNIX time:
<code>read_squid</code> turns them into POSIXlt timestamps, assuming UTC as an
origin timezone.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>time_elapsed: the amount of time (in milliseconds) that the connection and fulfilment
of the request lasted for.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ip_address: the IP address of the remote host making the request.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>status_code: the status code and Squid response code associated with that request,
stored as a single field. This can be split into two distinct fields with <code>split_squid</code>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bytes_sent: the number of bytes sent
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>http_method: the HTTP method (POST, GET, etc) used.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>url: the URL of the requested asset.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>remote_user_ident: the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1413">RFC 1413</a> remote
user identifier.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>peer_info: the status of how forwarding to a peer server was handled and, if the
request was forwarded, the server it was sent to.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Identify date frequency based on a series of dates</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><a href="https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental"><img src="../help/figures/lifecycle-experimental.svg" alt="[Experimental]"></a>
</p>
<p>Takes a vector of dates and identify whether the frequency is 'daily',
'weekly', or 'monthly'. The primary use case for this function is to provide
an accurate description of the query type used and for raising errors should
a wrong date grouping be used in the data input.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">identify_datefreq(x)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>Vector containing a series of dates.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Date frequency detection works as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> If at least three days of the week are present (e.g., Monday, Wednesday,
Thursday) in the series, then the series is classified as 'daily'
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> If the total number of months in the series is equal to the length, then
the series is classified as 'monthly'
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> If the total number of sundays in the series is equal to the length of
the series, then the series is classified as 'weekly
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>String describing the detected date frequency, i.e.:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> 'daily'
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> 'weekly'
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> 'monthly'
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Limitations</h3>

<p>One of the assumptions made behind the classification is that weeks are
denoted with Sundays, hence the count of sundays to measure the number of
weeks. In this case, weeks where a Sunday is missing would result in an
'unable to classify' error.
</p>
<p>Another assumption made is that dates are evenly distributed, i.e. that the
gap between dates are equal. If dates are unevenly distributed, e.g. only two
days of the week are available for a given week, then the algorithm will fail
to identify the frequency as 'daily'.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">start_date &lt;- as.Date("2022/06/26")
end_date &lt;- as.Date("2022/11/27")

# Daily
day_seq &lt;-
  seq.Date(
    from = start_date,
    to = end_date,
    by = "day"
  )

identify_datefreq(day_seq)

# Weekly
week_seq &lt;-
  seq.Date(
    from = start_date,
    to = end_date,
    by = "week"
  )

identify_datefreq(week_seq)

# Monthly
month_seq &lt;-
  seq.Date(
    from = start_date,
    to = end_date,
    by = "month"
  )
identify_datefreq(month_seq)

<h4>Method <code>new()</code>
</h4>

<p>It initializes the current object. It is used to set the
model file name and verbose options.

<div class="arguments">

<dl>
<dt><code>mf</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The model file name.</p>

<h4>Method <code>get_model()</code>
</h4>

<p>Returns the Model class object.
</p>


<h5>Usage</h5>

<div class="r"><pre>ModelPredictor$get_model()</pre></div>



<h5>Returns</h5>

<p>The Model class object is returned.

<a id="method-ModelPredictor-calc_perplexity"></a>



<h4>Method <code>calc_perplexity()</code>
</h4>

<p>The Perplexity for the given sentence is calculated. For
each word, the probability of the word given the previous words is
calculated. The probabilities are multiplied and then inverted. The
nth root of the result is the perplexity, where n is the number of
words in the sentence. If the stem_words tokenization option was
specified when creating the given model file, then the previous words
are converted to their stems.
</p>


<h5>Usage</h5>

<div class="r"><pre>ModelPredictor$calc_perplexity(words)</pre></div>



<h5>Arguments</h5>

<div class="arguments">

<dl>
<dt><code>words</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The list of words.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>



<h5>Returns</h5>

<p>The perplexity of the given list of words.
</p>

<a id="method-ModelPredictor-predict_word"></a>



<h4>Method <code>predict_word()</code>
</h4>

<p>Predicts the next word given a list of previous words. It
checks the last n previous words in the transition probabilities
data, where n is equal to 1 - n-gram size of model. If there is a
match, the top 3 next words with highest probabilities are returned.
If there is no match, then the last n-1 previous words are checked.
This process is continued until the last word is checked. If there is
no match, then empty result is returned. The given words may
optionally be stemmed.
</p>


<h5>Usage</h5>

<div class="r"><pre>ModelPredictor$predict_word(words, count = 3, dc = NULL)</pre></div>



<h5>Arguments</h5>

<div class="arguments">

<dl>
<dt><code>words</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>A character vector of previous words or a single vector
containing the previous word text.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>count</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The number of results to return.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>dc</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>A DataCleaner object. If it is given, then the given words</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>



<h5>Returns</h5>

<p>The top 3 predicted words along with their probabilities.

<a id="method-ModelPredictor-get_word_prob"></a>



<h4>Method <code>get_word_prob()</code>
</h4>

<p>Calculates the probability of the given word given the
previous words. The last n words are converted to numeric hash using
digest2int function. All other words are ignored. n is equal to 1 -
size of the n-gram model. The hash is looked up in a data frame of
transition probabilities. The last word is converted to a number by
checking its position in a list of unique words. If the hash and the
word position were found, then the probability of the previous word
and hash is returned. If it was not found, then the hash of the n-1
previous words is taken and the processed is repeated. If the data
was not found in the data frame, then the word probability is
returned. This is known as back-off. If the word probability could
not be found then the default probability is returned. The default
probability is calculated as 1/(N+V), Where N = number of words in
corpus and V is the number of dictionary words.

<h5>Arguments</h5>

<div class="arguments">

<dl>
<dt><code>word</code></dt>
<dd>

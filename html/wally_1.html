<h2>divat data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Extracted data from a french population based cohort (DIVAT cohort). The dataset includes 
followup information on kidney graft failure  outcome and predicted 5-year risks based on 
based on the subject specific information which includes age, gender,
cardiovascular and diabetes histories, monitoring of the evolution of the kidney function
measured via serum creatinine and relevant characteristics of his or her kidney donor.
Graft failure is defined as either death with functioning kidney graft or return to dialysis.
The prediction model from which the predictions have been computed has been previously fitted
using an independent training sample from the DIVAT data. Details about data and modeling can
be found in Fournier et al. (2016).

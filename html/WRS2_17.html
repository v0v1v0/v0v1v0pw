<h2>Beer Goggles Effect</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset is about the effects of alcohol on mate selection in night-clubs. The hypothesis is that after alcohol had been consumed, subjective perceptions of physical attractiveness would become more inaccurate (beer-goggles effect). There are 48 participants: 24 males, 24 
females. The reseacher took 3 groups of 8 participants to a night club. One group got no alcohol, one group 2 pints, and one group 4 pints. 
At the end of the evening the researcher took a photograph of the person the participant was chatting up. The attractiveness of the person 
on the photo was then evaluated by independent judges.

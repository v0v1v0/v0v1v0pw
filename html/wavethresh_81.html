<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>wp</code> produces a wavelet packet object. The coefficients in this structure can be organised into a binary tree with each node in the tree containing a packet of coefficients. 
</p>
<p>Each packet of coefficients is obtained by chaining together the effect of the <em>two packet operators</em> DG and DH: these are the high and low pass quadrature mirror filters of the Mallat pyramid algorithm scheme followed by decimation (see Mallat~(1989b)). 
</p>
<p>Starting with data <code class="reqn">c^J</code> at resolution level J containing
<code class="reqn">2^J</code> data points the wavelet packet algorithm operates as follows.
First DG and DH are applied to <code class="reqn">c^J</code> producing
<code class="reqn">d^{J-1}</code> and <code class="reqn">c^{J-1}</code> respectively.
Each of these sets of coefficients is of length one half of the original data:
i.e. <code class="reqn">2^{J-1}</code>.
Each of these sets of coefficients is a set of
<em>wavelet packet coefficients</em>.
The algorithm then applies both DG and DH to both
<code class="reqn">d^{J-1}</code> and <code class="reqn">c^{J-1}</code> to form a four sets of coefficients at level
J-2. Both operators are used again on the four sets to produce 8 sets, then again on the 8 sets to form 16 sets and so on. At level j=J,...,0 there are
<code class="reqn">2^{J-j}</code> packets of coefficients each containing <code class="reqn">2^j</code> coefficients. 
</p>
<p>This function enables whole packets of coefficients to be extracted at any resolution level. The index argument chooses a particular packet within each level and thus ranges from 0 (which always refer to the father wavelet coefficients), 1 (which always refer to the mother wavelet coefficients) up to <code class="reqn">2^{J-j}</code>. 
</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">#
# Take the wavelet packet transform of some random data
#
MyWP &lt;- wp(rnorm(1:512))
#
# The above data set was 2^9 in length. Therefore there are
# coefficients at resolution levels 0, 1, 2, ..., and 8.
#
# The high resolution coefficients are at level 8.
# There should be 256 DG coefficients and 256 DH coefficients
#
length(getpacket(MyWP, level=8, index=0))
#[1] 256
length(getpacket(MyWP, level=8, index=1))
#[1] 256
#
# The next command shows that there are only two packets at level 8
#
## Not run: getpacket(MyWP, level=8, index=2)
#Index was too high, maximum for this level is  1 
#Error in getpacket.wp(MyWP, level = 8, index = 2): Error occured
#Dumped
#
# There should be 4 coefficients at resolution level 2
#
# The father wavelet coefficients are (index=0)
getpacket(MyWP, level=2, index=0)
#[1] -0.9736576  0.5579501  0.3100629 -0.3834068
#
# The mother wavelet coefficients are (index=1)
#
#[1]  0.72871405  0.04356728 -0.43175307  1.77291483
#
# There will be 127 packets at this level.

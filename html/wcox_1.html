<h2>Calculate inverse probability of selection weights.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function calculates weights to correct for ascertainment bias in
time-to-event data where clusters are outcome-dependently sampled,
for example high-risk families in genetic epidemiological studies in
cancer research.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">Calculate_weights(dat)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dat</code></td>
<td>
<p>Data.frame with one row per individual with columns <em>d</em>
non-censoring indicator; <strong>k</strong> interval of (age) group; <strong>S_k</strong>
population interval-based proportion of individuals experiencing the
event in intervals later than k; <strong>S_k.</strong> sample
proportion of individuals experiencing the event in intervals later
than k.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Weights are based on a comparison between the survival between sample and
population. Therefore, besides the sample data, the population incidence rate
(per 100 000) is needed as input, as well as the cut-offs of the
(age/time-to-event) groups for which this is available. The function provides
two options for the latter: cut-offs can be provided manually or using the
standard 5- or 10-years (age) categories (0-4, 5-9, ... or 0-9, 10-14, ...).
Note that resulting intervals are of the form [xx, xx).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Vector with weights.

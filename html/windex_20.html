<h2>
Checks a set of phylogenetic trees to confirm they are ultrametric and binary and that tip labels match a list of names.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Takes a set of phylogenetic trees as a multiPhylo object (or a single tree as a phylo object) and a vector (e.g. of species names) and reports which trees (if any) are not binary, not ultrametric, or have tip labels that don't match the vector of names.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">treedatacheck(trees,species)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>trees</code></td>
<td>

<p>Set of phylogenetic trees of class 'multiPhylo' or 'phylo' containing branch lengths.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>species</code></td>
<td>

<p>Vector of names to be matched against tip labels of the tree(s).
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Either confirms that all trees are binary, ultrametric, and have tip labels matching the list of names, or prints warnings stating which trees do not meet those criteria (with troubleshooting options for mismatches between data and single trees).

<h2>Quantifying performance of a diagnostic test using the sampling distribution
of the weight of evidence favouring case over noncase status</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <span class="pkg">wevid</span> package provides functions for quantifying the performance
of a diagnostic test (or any other binary classifier) by calculating and
plotting the distributions in cases and noncases of the weight of evidence
favouring case over noncase status.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The distributions of the weight of evidence (log Bayes factor) favouring
case over noncase status in a test dataset (or test folds generated by
cross-validation) can be used to quantify the performance of a diagnostic
test.
</p>
<p>In comparison with the C-statistic (area under ROC curve), the expected
weight of evidence (expected information for discrimination) has several
advantages as a summary measure of predictive performance. To quantify how
the predictor will behave as a risk stratifier, the quantiles of the
distributions of weight of evidence in cases and controls can be calculated
and plotted.
</p>
<p>This package can be used with any test dataset on which you have observed
case-control status and have computed prior and posterior probabilities of
case status using a model learned on a training dataset.
Therefore, you should have computed on a test dataset (or on test folds used
for cross-validation):
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> The prior probability of case status (this may be just the frequency of
cases in the training data).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The posterior probability of case status (using the model learned on
the training data to predict on the test data).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The observed case status (coded as 0 for noncases, 1 for cases).
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The main function of the package is <code>Wdensities</code> which computes
the crude and model-based densities of weight of evidence in cases and
controls. Once these are computed, they can be plotted with
<code>plotWdists</code> and <code>plotcumfreqs</code>. Summary statistics
can be reported with <code>summary</code>.

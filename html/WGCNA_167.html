observation.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>y</code></td>
<td>

<p>The response variable. Can be a single vector or a matrix with arbitrary many columns. Number of rows
(observations) must equal to the number of rows (observations) in x.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>xtest</code></td>
<td>

<p>Optional test set data. A matrix of the same number of columns (i.e., features) as <code>x</code>.

</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>assocFnc</code></td>
<td>

<p>Character string specifying the association function. The association function should behave roughly as
<code>link{cor}</code> in that it takes two arguments
(a matrix and a vector) plus options 
and returns the vector of associations between the columns of the matrix and the
vector. The associations may be signed (i.e., negative or positive).

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>assocCut.hi</code></td>
<td>

<p>Association (or featureSignificance) threshold for including features in the predictor. Features with
associtation higher than <code>assocCut.hi</code> will be included. If not given, the threshold method will not be

<p>One of <code>"mean"</code> and <code>"eigensample"</code>, specifies how the centroid should be calculated.
<code>"mean"</code> takes the mean across all samples (or all samples within a sample module, if sample networks
are used), whereas <code>"eigensample"</code> calculates the first principal component of the feature matrix and
uses that as the centroid.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>simFnc</code></td>
<td>

<p>Character string giving the similarity function for measuring the similarity between test samples and
centroids. This function should
behave roughly like the function <code>cor</code> in that it takes two arguments (<code>x</code>, <code>y</code>)
and calculates the pair-wise similarities between columns of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>. For convenience, the
value <code>"dist"</code> is treated specially: the Euclidean distance between the columns of <code>x</code> and
<code>y</code> is calculated and its negative is returned (so that smallest distance corresponds to highest
similarity). Since values of this function are only used for ranking centroids, its values are not
restricted to be positive or within certain bounds.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Nearest centroid predictor works by forming a representative profile (centroid) 
across features for each class from
the training data, then assigning each test sample to the class of the nearest representative profile. The
representative profile can be formed either as mean or as athe first principal component ("eigensample";
this choice is governed by the option <code>centroidMethod</code>).
</p>
<p>When the number of features is large and only a small fraction is likely to be associated with the outcome, 
feature selection can be used to restrict the features that actually enter the centroid. Feature selection
can be based either on their association with the outcome
calculated from the training data using <code>assocFnc</code>, or on user-supplied feature significance (e.g.,
derived from literature, argument
<code>featureSignificance</code>). In either case, features can be selected by high and low association tresholds 
or by taking a fixed number of highest- and lowest-associated features. 
</p>
<p>As an alternative to centroids, the predictor can also assign test samples based on a given quantile of the
distances from the training samples in each class (argument <code>useQuantile</code>). This may be advantageous if
the samples in each class form irregular clusters. Note that setting <code>useQuantile=0</code> (i.e., using
minimum distance in each class) essentially gives a nearest neighbor predictor: each test sample will be
assigned to the class of its nearest training neighbor.
</p>
<p>If features exhibit non-trivial correlations among themselves (such as, for example, in gene expression
data), one can attempt to down-weigh features that do not exhibit the same correlation in the test set.
This is done by using essentially the same predictor to predict _features_ from all other features in the
test data (using the training data to train the feature predictor). Because test features are known, the
prediction accuracy can be evaluated. If a feature is predicted badly (meaning the error in the test set is
much larger than the error in the cross-validation prediction in training data),
it may mean that its quality in the
training or test data is low (for example, due to excessive noise or outliers).
Such features can be downweighed using the argument <code>weighByPrediction</code>. The extra factor is
min(1, (root mean square prediction error in test set)/(root mean square cross-validation prediction error
in
the trainig data)^weighByPrediction), that is it is never bigger than 1.
</p>
<p>Unless the features' mean and variance can be ascribed clear meaning, the (training) features should be
scaled to mean 0 and variance 1 before the centroids are formed. 
</p>
<p>The function implements a basic option for removal of spurious effects in the training and test data, by
removng a fixed number of leading principal components from the features. This sometimes leads to better
prediction accuracy but should be used with caution.
</p>
<p>If samples within each class are heterogenous, a single centroid may not represent each class well. This
function can deal with within-class heterogeneity by clustering samples (separately in each class), then
using a one representative (mean, eigensample) or quantile for each cluster in each class to assign test
samples. Various similarity measures, specified by <code>adjFnc</code>, can be used to construct the sample network
adjacency. Similarly, the user can specify a clustering function using <code>clusteringFnc</code>. The
requirements on the clustering function are described in a separate section below.

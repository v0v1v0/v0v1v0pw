<h2>Data about helicopters</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A small database with real helicopter names and criteria that make sense.
The values and weights are generated at random.
The only requirement for the methods is that their sum be 1.
The set of Cost - Benefit flags make no sense in terms of the criteria they
refer to and are just a set of strings starting with the letter "C" (cost) or
"B" (benefit). That is, a criterion that must be monotonic of benefit
want to maximize it) can have a "c" flag, while a criterion that the (we user
would rightly judge to be cost (we want to minimize it) can have a "b" flag.

relative importance to the values of the criteria in percentage terms,
thus making a weighting of these criteria.</p>
</dd>
<dt>flags</dt>
<dd>
<p>They determine whether the specific criterion is cost, that is,
the smaller, the better, or benefit, the greater the better.

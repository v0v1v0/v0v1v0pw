<h2>
Converting GPML FIles to Igraph Objects
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Takes a GPML file from WikiPathways, extracts the entities therein,
and makes minor adjustments necessary to convert it into an
<code>igraph</code> object. Along the way, it assigns a consistent set
of colors, line types, and shapes. 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">GPMLtoIgraph(xmldoc, returnLists = FALSE, debug = FALSE)
nodeLegend(x, graph)
edgeLegend(x, graph)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>xmldoc</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either the name of an XML file meeting the
specifications of the Genomic Pathway Markup Language (GPML), or an
object of class <code>XMLInternalDocument</code> obtained by running such
a file through the <code>xmlParseDoc</code> function of the <code>XML</code>
package.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>returnLists</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical value; should the return value
include the node list and edge list matrices?</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>debug</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical value; should debugging progress information be
printed? Probably best to leave it equal to FALSE.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character string, such as "topleft" indicating where
to place the legend.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>graph</code></td>
<td>
<p>An <code>igraph</code> object as produced by the
function<code>GPMLtoIgraph</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>GPMLtoIgraph</code> is the main function of the
<code>WayFindR</code>package. It achieves the primary goal of converting
pathways from the GPML file format to a mathematical graph, in the
format defined by the <code>igraph</code> package, at which point we
can apply a wide variety of graph algorithms from computer science in
order to "compute on biological pathways".
</p>
<p>The implementation of <code>GPMLtoIgraph</code> relies on the utility
functions described in gpml-utility. Briefly, the algorithm
starts by collecting all nodes (<code>DataNodes</code> in GPML) and edges
(<code>Interactions</code> in GPML) from the GPML input file. However, GPML
includes two other structures with (semantic) biological
meaning. First, the GPML description includes the idea of an
(invisible) "<code>Anchor</code>" that allows one edge to point to another
edge. We expand those invisible target locations into full-fledged
nodes in the final graph. Second, GPML includes "<code>Group</code>s"
that represent protein complexes or sets of closely related genes.  In
<code>WayFindR</code>, we represent such groups as their own nodes in the
final graph, and add "contained" edges linking in the group members.
The transformations of Anchors and Groups do not change the
fnudamental topology (in particular, the existence of cycles) of the
resulting graph.
</p>
<p>Finally, GPML includes non-semantic features (including "<code>Labels</code>"
and "<code>Shapes</code>") that are (mis)used by some pathway authors as the
targets of edges. <code>WayFindR</code> converts any targeted non-semantic
features into nodes in order to preserve as much information as
possible from the original pathway in WikiPathways.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The <code>GMLtoIgraph</code> function usually returns an <code>igraph</code>
object that represents the pathway defined by the input
<code>xmlfile</code>. If the argument <code>returnLists = TRUE</code>, then it
returns a list containing three components; <code>graph</code> is the
<code>igraph</code> object, <code>nodes</code> is a data frame containing node
information where each row is a node, and <code>edges</code> is a matrix
containing edge information where each row is an edge. The node and
edge information can be used to reproduce the graph in any network or
graph visualization tool that accepts such matrices to describe the
graph. The <code>nodes</code> data frame includes columns for <code>color</code>
and <code>shape</code>, and the <code>edges</code> data frame includes columns for
<code>color</code> and <code>lty</code> that are recognized and used by the
<code>plot.igraph</code> function.
</p>
<p>Both <code>nodeLegend</code> and <code>edgeLegend</code> invisibly return the same
value that is returned by the <code>legend</code> function that is
used in the implementation.

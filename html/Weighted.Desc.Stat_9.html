<h2> weighted Pearson's correlation coefficent </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

 
<p>Assume that <code class="reqn">x=(x_1, x_2, \cdots , x_n)</code> is the observed value of a random sample from a fuzzy population. 
In classical and usual random sample, the degree of belonging <code class="reqn">x_i</code> into the random sample is equal to 1, for <code class="reqn">1 \leq i  \leq  n</code>.
But considering fuzzy population, we denote the degree of belonging <code class="reqn">x_i</code> into the fuzzy population (or into the observed value of random sample) by <code class="reqn">\mu_i</code> which is a real-valued number from [0,1].
Therefore in such situations, it is more appropriate that we show the observed value of the random sample by notation <code class="reqn"> \{ (x_1, \mu_1),  (x_2, \mu_2), \cdots , (x_n, \mu_n) \} </code> which we called it real-valued fuzzy data.
The goal of  w.r  function is computing the Pearson's correlation coefficent (or, the weighted Pearson's correlation coefficent) between two vector-valued data sets <code class="reqn">x_1, \cdots , x_n</code> and  <code class="reqn">y_1, \cdots , y_n</code>  based on real-valued fuzzy data <code class="reqn"> \{ (x_1, \mu_1), \cdots , (x_n, \mu_n) \} </code>  and <code class="reqn"> \{ (y_1, \mu_1), \cdots , (y_n, \mu_n) \} </code>  by formula  <code class="reqn"> r = \frac{s_{xy}}{s_x s_y}.</code>
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">w.r(x, y, mu)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x, y</code></td>
<td>

<p>Two vector-valued numeric data sets which you want to compute the weighted Pearson's correlation coefficent between them. 
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mu</code></td>
<td>

<p>A vector of weights. The length of this vector must be equal to the length of data sets and each element of it is belongs to interval [0,1].
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The weighted correlation coefficent between two vectors x and y, by considering weights vector mu, is numeric or a vector of length one.
</p>


<h3>Warning </h3>

<p>The length of x, y and mu must be equal. Also, each element of mu must be in interval [0,1].

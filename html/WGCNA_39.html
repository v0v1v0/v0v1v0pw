<h2>Blood Cell Types with Corresponding Gene Markers</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This matrix gives a predefined set of marker genes for many blood cell types, as reported in several previously-published studies.  It is used with userListEnrichment to search user-defined gene lists for enrichment.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(BloodLists)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A 2048 x 2 matrix of characters containing Gene / Category pairs.  The first column (Gene) lists genes corresponding to a given category (second column).  Each Category entry is of the form &lt;Blood cell type&gt;__&lt;reference&gt;, where the references can be found at <code>userListEnrichment</code>.  Note that the matrix is sorted first by Category and then by Gene, such that all genes related to the same category are listed sequentially.

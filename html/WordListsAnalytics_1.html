<h2>This function receives a property listing task, a given concept, and a threshold. It clusterizes
the data according to the order of the listed properties. Given the mentioned properties of all
users for a specific concept, the algorithm estimates a similarity among properties, based on
the number of words mentioned between properties. For example, if the properties A and B are
usually mentioned one after another, their similarity will be higher than the properties A and C
which are usually not even mentioned together. The properties with low similarity to all other
properties (below the user-defined threshold) are discarded from the plot.</h2>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">clusterImage(data, distThreshold, concept = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>Data frame with 3 columns: ID, Concept and Property</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>distThreshold</code></td>
<td>
<p>Distance value. It assign properties to specific cluster if their similarity is greater than distThreshold</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>concept</code></td>
<td>
<p>Text value. Clusters will only be generated with properties from this concept.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>List with 2 elements: ggplot2 plot and data frame with cluster information
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data_cpn = data.frame(CPN_27)
threshold = 0.061
concept = "Ability"
cluster_data = clusterImage(data_cpn, threshold, concept)

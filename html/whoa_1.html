<h2>bin read depths of SNPs into categories having at least S observations</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>bin read depths of SNPs into categories having at least S observations
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">bin_depths(D, S)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>D</code></td>
<td>
<p>a matrix of read depths.  Rows are individuals, columns are SNPs.  Cells where data are missing
in the genotype matrix must be denoted as NA</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>S</code></td>
<td>
<p>the min number of observations to have in each bin</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>This returns a list with two components.  <code>dp_bins</code> is a matrix of the same
shape as D with the bin categories (as 1, 2, ...) and -1 for this cells
corresponding to missing genotypes.  <code>num_cats</code> is the number of depth bins.
<code>tidy_bins</code> is a long format description of the bins.
<code>bin_stats</code> is a tibble giving summary information about the read depth bins which
is useful for plotting things, etc.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
# get a matrix of read depths and make it an integer matrix
depths &lt;- vcfR::extract.gt(lobster_buz_2000, element = "DP")
storage.mode(depths) &lt;- "integer"

# get a character matrix of genotypes, so we can figure out which
# are missing and mask those from depths
genos &lt;- vcfR::extract.gt(lobster_buz_2000, element = "GT")

# make missing in depths if missing in genos
depths[is.na(genos)] &lt;- NA

# bin the read depths into bins with at least 1000 observations in each bin
bins &lt;- bin_depths(depths, 1000)

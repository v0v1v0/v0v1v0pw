<h2>
Generate example data tables as presented in "Accelerated Testing" by Wayne Nelson
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function generates life test data tables suitable for use in example scripts.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">	NelsonData(x)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>

<p>Either a character string defining one of "table2.2", "table3.1", "table4.1" or "table5.1 or
a numeric of the table digits.
</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This method of data provision has been found necessary since inclusion of table3.1 and table5.1
created a problem with a "Warning: object '.Random.seed' is created by more than one data call"
which prevented lazyData=yes to be in the package definition.  Without lazyData I could never seem
to make data files avialable to example scripts within the package.
</p>
<p>Table 2.1 is presented on page115 of Wayne Nelson's book "Accelerated Testing".
It purports to represent a series tests on  a Class H insulation at elevated temperatures (in deg C)
</p>
<p>Table 3.1 is presented on page129 of Wayne Nelson's book "Accelerated Testing".
It purports to represent a series tests on an insulating fluid at elevated voltages.
</p>
<p>Table 4.1 is presented on page135 of Wayne Nelson's book "Accelerated Testing".
It purports to represent a series tests on  a Class B insulation at elevated temperatures (in deg C)
</p>
<p>Table 5.1 is presented on page 393 of Wayne Nelson's book "Accelerated Testing".
It is interesting to note that items $T190, $T220, $T240, and $T260 represent
a Table 5.1 presented  on page 140. In Chapter 7 this data forms an example of 
competing modes analysis covering modes of failure on motorette turns, phase, and ground.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The returned object is either a dataframe or a list that can be accessed by the names of the olumns or elments.

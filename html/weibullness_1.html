<h2>Dataset</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>bearings</code>: It is from Lieblein and Zelen (1956). 
These data are deep-groove ball bearings failure times (number of millions of revolutions) in eudurance tests.
</p>
<p><code>glassfiber1.5</code> and <code>glassfiber15</code>: They are from Smith and Naylor (1987).
These datasets are from experimental data for the strength of glass fiber of length 1.5cm and 15cm, respectively.
</p>
<p><code>urinary</code>: It is from Santiago and Smith (2013).
It is about the days in between discharge of males in nosocomial urinary tract infections in patients.
</p>
<p><code>radiotherapy</code> and <code>radio.chemotherapy</code>: They are from Finkelstein, D. M. (1986) 
and Lindsey, J. C. and L. M. Ryan (1998). 
These data are interval-censored observations from a study of patients with breast cancer. 
The measurement is the time to cosmetic deterioration of the breast for women who received radiotherapy 
and women who received radio-chemotherapy.

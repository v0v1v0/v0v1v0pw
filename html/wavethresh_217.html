<h2>Computes the minimum of the SURE thresholding function</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Computes the minimum of the SURE thresholding function for
wavelet shrinkage as described in Donoho, D.L. and Johnstone, I.M.
(1995) Adapting to unknown smoothness via wavelet shrinkage.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">sure(x)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>Vector of (normalized) wavelet coefficients. Coefficients
should be supplied divided by their standard deviation, or
some robust measure of scale</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>SURE is a method for unbiasedly estimating the risk of an estimator. Stein (1981) showed that for a nearly arbitrary, nonlinear biased estimator, one can estimate its loss unbiasedly. See the Donoho and Johnstone, 1995 for further references and explanation. This function minimizes formula (11) from that paper.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The absolute value of the wavelet coefficient that minimizes the
SURE criteria

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">#
# Let's create "pretend" vector of wavelet coefficients contaminated with
# "noise".
#
v &lt;- c(0.1, -0.2, 0.3, -0.4, 0.5, 99, 12, 6)
#
# Now, what's sure of this?
#
sure(v)
#
# [1] 0.5
#
#
# I.e. the large significant coefficients are 99, 12, 6 and the noise is
# anything less than this in abs value. So sure(v) is a good point to threshold
# at.

<h2>Load a vocabulary file</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Load a vocabulary file
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">load_vocab(vocab_file)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>vocab_file</code></td>
<td>
<p>path to vocabulary file. File is assumed to be a text file,
with one token per line, with the line number corresponding to the index of
that token in the vocabulary.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The vocab as a character vector of tokens. The casedness of the
vocabulary is inferred and attached as the "is_cased" attribute. The
vocabulary indices are taken to be the positions of the tokens,
<em>starting at zero</em> for historical consistency.
</p>
<p>Note that from the perspective of a neural net, the numeric indices <em>are</em>
the tokens, and the mapping from token to index is fixed. If we changed the
indexing (the order of the tokens), it would break any pre-trained models.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Get path to sample vocabulary included with package.
vocab_path &lt;- system.file("extdata", "tiny_vocab.txt", package = "wordpiece")
vocab &lt;- load_vocab(vocab_file = vocab_path)
</code></pre>

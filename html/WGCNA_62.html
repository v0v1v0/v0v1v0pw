<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function computes 3 types of network concepts (also known as network indices or statistics) based on
an adjacency matrix and optionally a node significance measure. Specifically, it computes I) fundamental
network concepts, II) conformity based network concepts, and III) approximate conformity based network
concepts.
These network concepts are defined for any symmetric adjacency matrix (weighted and unweighted). The
network concepts are described in Dong and Horvath (2007) and Horvath and Dong (2008).
In the following, we use the term gene and node interchangeably since these methods were originally
developed for gene networks. In the following, we briefly describe the 
3 types of network concepts:
</p>
<p>Type I: fundamental network concepts are defined as a function of the off-diagonal elements of an
adjacency matrix A and/or a node significance measure GS. 
Type II: conformity-based network concepts are functions of the off-diagonal elements of the conformity
based adjacency matrix A.CF=CF*t(CF) and/or the node significance measure. These network concepts are
defined for any network for which a conformity vector can be defined. Details: For any adjacency matrix
A, the conformity vector CF is calculated by requiring that A[i,j] is approximately equal to CF[i]*CF[j].
Using the conformity one can define the matrix A.CF=CF*t(CF) which is the outer product of the conformity
vector with itself. In general, A.CF is not an adjacency matrix since its diagonal elements are different
from 1. If the off-diagonal elements of A.CF are similar to those of A according to the Frobenius matrix
norm, then A is approximately factorizable. To measure the factorizability of a network, one can
calculate the Factorizability, which is a number between 0 and 1 (Dong and Horvath 2007). The conformity
is defined using a monotonic, iterative algorithm that maximizes the factorizability measure. 
Type III: approximate conformity based network concepts are functions of all elements of the conformity
based adjacency matrix A.CF (including the diagonal) and/or the node significance measure GS. These
network concepts are very useful for deriving relationships between network concepts in networks that are
approximately factorizable.

<p>fundamental network concepts, that is network concepts calculated directly from

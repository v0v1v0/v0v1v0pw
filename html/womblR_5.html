<h2>HFAII Rook Adjacency Matrix</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Binary adjacency matrix for the Humphrey Field Analyzer-II (Carl Zeiss Meditec Inc., Dublin, CA)
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(HFAII_Rook)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>This adjacency matrix is formated using rook neighbor criteria, meaning two locations on
the visual field are only considered neighbors if they share an edge. The adjacency matrix is a
54 x 54 dimensional binary object with zeros on the diagonal and the column and row sums are equal
to the number of neighbors.

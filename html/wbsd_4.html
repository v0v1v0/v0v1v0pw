<h2>
Wild Bootstrap Size Diagnostics
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The package <span class="pkg">wbsd</span> provides functions for testing affine hypotheses on the regression coefficient vector in linear
regression models with heteroskedastic errors based on the wild bootstrap. 
In particular, it provides (i) the function <code>theta</code> to compute the value of the
diagnostic “theta” suggested in the article Pötscher and 
Preinerstorfer (2020); and it provides (ii) the function <code>boot.pval</code> to obtain
bootstrap p-values. Various test statistics (null-restricted/unrestricted covariance estimator; classical F-test and F-tests based on HC0 - HC4 covariance estimators) are included.
The functions also cover various bootstrap schemes. We refer the user to Pötscher and Preinerstorfer (2020) for:
details concerning the framework, test statistics, bootstrap schemes,
the definition of theta (depending on the test statistic and scheme used), the
underlying theoretical results, and for further references.

<p>maximum number of restarts. Default is 10 so that we
stand a good chance of getting a full set of clusters. Normally, any
empty clusters that result are removed from the result, and so we may
obtain fewer than k clusters if we don't allow restarts (i.e.,
maxrestart=0). If &lt; 0 then there is no limit on the number of restarts
and we are much more likely to get a full set of k clusters.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The entopy weighted k-means clustering algorithm is a subspace
clusterer ideal for high dimensional data. Along with each cluster we
also obtain variable weights that provide a relative measure of the
importance of each variable to that cluster.
</p>
<p>The algorithm is based on the k-means approach to clustering. An
initial set of k means are identified as the starting
centroids. Observartions are clustered to the nearest centroid
according to a distance measure. This defines the initial
clustrering. New centroids are then identified based on these
clusters.
</p>
<p>Weights are then calculated for each variable within each cluster,
based on the current clustering.  The weights are a measure of the
relative importance of each variable with regard to the membership of
the observations to that cluster. These weights are then incorporated
into the distance function, typically reducing the distance for the
more important variables.
</p>
<p>New centroids are then calculated, and using the weighted distance
measure each observation is once again clustered to its nearest
centroid.
</p>
<p>The process continues until convergence (using a measure of dispersion
and stopping when the change becomes less than delta) or until a
specified number of iterations has been reached (maxiter).
</p>
<p>Large lambda (e,g, &gt; 3) lead to a relatively even distribution of
weights across the variables. Small lambda (e.g., &lt; 1) lead to a more
uneven distribution of weights, giving more discrimintation between
features. Recommended values are between 1 and 3.
</p>
<p>Always check the number of iterations, the number of restarts, and the
total number of iterations as they give a good indication of whether
the algorithm converged.
</p>
<p>As with any distance based algorithm, be sure to rescale your numeric
data so that large values do not bias the clustering. A quick
rescaling method to use is <code>scale</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns an object of class "kmeans" and "ewkm", compatible with other
functions that work with kmeans objects, such as the 'print'
method. The object is a list with the following components in addition
to the components of the kmeans object:
</p>
<p>weights: A matrix of weights recording the relative importance of each
variable for each cluster.
</p>
<p>iterations: This reports on the number of iterations before
termination. Check this to see whether the maxiters was reached. If so
then the algroithm may not be converging,and thus the resulting
clustering may not be particularly good.
</p>
<p>restarts: The number of times the clustering restarted because of a
disappearing cluster resulting from one or more k-means having no
observations associated with it. An number here greater than 0
indicates that the algorithm is not converging on a clustering for the
given k. It is recommended that k be reduced.
</p>
<p>total.iterations: The total number of iterations over all restarts.

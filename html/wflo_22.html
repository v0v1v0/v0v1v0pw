<h2>For a given distance <code>x</code>, computes the penalty factor for a turbine's wake.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In Jensen's wake model, a wake cone is generated by a turbine based on the turbine's hub height z, its rotor radius r_0, the terrain's roughness length z_0 and the distance x between the turbine under investigation and a certain second point. z, r_0 and z_0 are taken from the <code>FarmVars</code> settings object, while x is to be provided.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">JensenFactor(x)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>

<p>must be a single value. Provide distance in meters.
</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>If a second turbine (B) is in a first turbine (A)'s wake, turbine B's power output must be penalized due to turbulence. This function computes the penalty factor for that wake.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>JensenFactor</code> returns the a single number between 0 and 1, which can immediately be used a a penalty factor.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Note that for Jensen's multiple wake model, wake penalties from several potentially influencing upwind turbines must be computed. As the factors are between 0 and 1, they can conveniently multiplied by each other afterward. If there are four turbines (A, B, C, D) inside a wind farm, you are investigating turbine D and it turns out that D is in the wake of B and C, but not A, then compute penalty for B (assume 0.7) and C (assume 0.8). Now, the penalty factors for A, B and C are 1, 0.7 and 0.8, so 1 * 0.7 * 0.8 = 0.56 is the penalty for turbine D.

<h3>See Also</h3>

<p>Use <code>JensenAngle</code> to compute the wake cone and with it, use <code>JensenTrapezoid</code> to see if another turbine B is in turbine A's wake. Apply <code>JensenFactor</code> only if this is the case.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">JensenFactor(500)
## Provided that turbine B is in turbine A's wake and that the two turbines are 500 meters apart,
## turbine B must be penalized by a factor of 0.7952.

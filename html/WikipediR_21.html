<h2>Retrieve user information</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Retrieves information about a user, or set of users, from the MediaWiki API,
including registration date, gender and editcount.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">user_information(
  language = NULL,
  project = NULL,
  domain = NULL,
  user_names,
  properties = c("blockinfo", "groups", "implicitgroups", "rights", "editcount",
    "registration", "emailable", "gender"),
  clean_response = FALSE,
  ...
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>language</code></td>
<td>
<p>The language code of the project you wish to query,
if appropriate.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>project</code></td>
<td>
<p>The project you wish to query ("wikiquote"), if appropriate.
Should be provided in conjunction with <code>language</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>domain</code></td>
<td>
<p>as an alternative to a <code>language</code> and <code>project</code> combination,
you can also provide a domain ("rationalwiki.org") to the URL constructor, allowing
for the querying of non-Wikimedia MediaWiki instances.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>user_names</code></td>
<td>
<p>The username(s) of the users you want information on - this should be provided
as a vector. There is a hard limit of 50 distinct users per query, set by MediaWiki's API;
in the event that you go over this, a warning will be issued and the query will only be
performed for the first 50 names in the vector.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>properties</code></td>
<td>
<p>The user properties you're interested in. Applicable properties are
"blockinfo" (details about the user's block, if they are currently blocked), "groups"
(the user groups the user is a member of), "implicitgroups" (groups they are a member of
through inheritance, as a result of membership in other groups), "rights" (what permissions
their group membership grants them), "editcount" (how many non-deleted edits they have),
"registration" (the date when they registered), "emailable" (whether they are contactable
through Special:EmailUser) and "gender" (their provided gender).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>clean_response</code></td>
<td>
<p>whether to do some basic sanitising of the resulting data structure.
Set to FALSE by default.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>further arguments to pass to httr's GET.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Warnings</h3>

<p>There are a few caveats with the data provided by <code>user_information</code>, mostly stemming from
historical inconsistencies and peculiarities in MediaWiki.
</p>
<p><code>groups</code> and <code>implicitgroups</code> gives you the user's permissions and group membership
on the project you are querying, not their membership on all projects - while you can find out
if "Ironholds" is not a sysop on, say, enwiki, that doesn't mean they aren't a sysop elsewhere
- there is no universal, API-accessible user groups listing.
</p>
<p>As an extension of the lack of centrality in Wikimedia's infrastructure, <code>registration</code>
tells you the date their account was created on the wiki you are querying. If they initially
registered on that wiki, this is accurate - if they registered on a different wiki,
this instead reflects the date and time that they first visited the wiki you're querying
while logged-in. For users registered before 2006, when registration logging was introduced,
the <code>registration</code> value represents not when they first registered, but when their first
edit was, since that was used as an estimator for existing accounts when the field was first
populated.

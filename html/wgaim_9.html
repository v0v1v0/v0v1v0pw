<h2>Genotypic marker data for Sunco x Tasman doubled haploid
population in R/qtl format</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Linkage map marker data for the Sunco x Tasman doubled haploid
population in the form of an R/qtl cross object.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(phenoSxT)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>This data relates to a linkage map of 287 genetic markers genotyped on 190
individuals from the Sunco x Tasman population. This set is reduced from
the original 345 markers (a mixture of AFLP, RFLP and microsatellite
markers and protein analysis). The reduction was created by discarding
58 markers which were co-located with one or more other markers. The
linkage map consists of 21 linkage groups with varying numbers of
markers. Map distances have been estimated using <code>read.cross()</code>
with the kosambi mapping function. The data is therefore an R/qtl
cross object. See <code>read.cross()</code> documentation for more details on the
format of this object.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
data(genoSxT, package = "wgaim")
linkMap(genoSxT, cex = 0.5)

</code></pre>

<h2>A package for calculating area correction values for fatality estimation at wind farms.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Post-construction fatality monitoring studies at wind facilities are based on data from searches for bird and bat carcasses in plots beneath turbines. Bird and bat carcasses can fall outside of the search plot. Bird and bat carcasses from wind turbines often fall outside of the searched area. To compensate, area correction (AC) estimations are calculated to estimate the percentage of fatalities that fall within the searched area versus those that fall outside of it. This package provides two likelihood based methods and one physics based method (Hull and Muir (2010), Huso and Dalthorp (2014)) to estimate the carcass fall distribution. There are also functions for calculating the proportion of area searched within one unit annuli, log logistic distribution functions, and truncated distribution functions.
</p>
<p>The two likelihood methods are the truncated weighted likelihood (<code>estTWL</code>) and the weighted distribution (<code>estWD</code>). Both use carcass distances from the turbine, accounting for unequal detection by distance, to estimate the distance distribution. Alternatively, a right triangle distribution can be used for the carcass density distribution with the max distance estimated (<code>hullMuirMaxDistance</code> from the regression from Hull and Muir (2010) as proposed by Huso and Dalthorp (2014).
</p>
<p>The area correction value is calculated from the combination of the carcass distance density and the proportion of area searched at each distance. The function <code>getProportionAreaSearched</code> uses the <code>sf</code> package to do this from turbine points spatial data and search area polygons. The functions <code>geometricRectanglePropSearchTable</code> and <code>geometricRoadPadPropSearchTable</code> also calculate proportion of area searched but assuming perfect geometric shapes, meaning no spatial data is required.
</p>
<p>Search areas are often irregular. <code>proportionAreaSearched</code> summarizes the area searched into the proportion of area searched with one unit annuli (or ring).
</p>
<p>Two sets of distribution functions are available. Log logistic distribution functions (see <code>dllog</code>). These are a transformation of the logistic distribution and use the base R functions (see <code>dlogis</code>).
The second is truncation functions (see <code>dtrunc</code>), that provide truncation for R function distributions.

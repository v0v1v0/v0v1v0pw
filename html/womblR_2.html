<h2>Garway-Heath angles for the HFA-II</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These Garway-Heath angles are used as the dissimilarity metric when implementing the boundary
detection model for a longitudinal series of visual fields.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(GarwayHeath)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A vector with length 54, where each entry represents the angle (in degrees) that the
underlying retinal nerve fiber enters the optic nerve head. The measure ranges from 0-360,
where 0  is designated at the 9-o’clock position (right eye) and angles are counted counter
clockwise. These angles are estimates for the Humphrey Field Analyzer-II (Carl Zeiss Meditec
Inc., Dublin, CA). The 26th and 35th entries are missing as they correspond to a natural
blind spot.

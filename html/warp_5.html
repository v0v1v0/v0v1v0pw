<h2>Compute distances from a date time origin</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>warp_distance()</code> is a low level engine for computing date time distances.
</p>
<p>It returns the distance from <code>x</code> to the <code>origin</code> in units
defined by the <code>period</code>.
</p>
<p>For example, <code>period = "year"</code> would return the number of years from
the <code>origin</code>. Setting <code>every = 2</code> would return the number of 2 year groups
from the <code>origin</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">warp_distance(x, period, ..., every = 1L, origin = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p><code style="white-space: pre;">⁠[Date / POSIXct / POSIXlt]⁠</code>
</p>
<p>A date time vector.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>period</code></td>
<td>
<p><code style="white-space: pre;">⁠[character(1)]⁠</code>
</p>
<p>A string defining the period to group by. Valid inputs can be roughly
broken into:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>"year"</code>, <code>"quarter"</code>, <code>"month"</code>, <code>"week"</code>, <code>"day"</code>
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>"hour"</code>, <code>"minute"</code>, <code>"second"</code>, <code>"millisecond"</code>
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>"yweek"</code>, <code>"mweek"</code>
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>"yday"</code>, <code>"mday"</code>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p><code style="white-space: pre;">⁠[dots]⁠</code>
</p>
<p>These dots are for future extensions and must be empty.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>every</code></td>
<td>
<p><code style="white-space: pre;">⁠[positive integer(1)]⁠</code>
</p>
<p>The number of periods to group together.
</p>
<p>For example, if the period was set to <code>"year"</code> with an every value of <code>2</code>,
then the years 1970 and 1971 would be placed in the same group.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>origin</code></td>
<td>
<p><code style="white-space: pre;">⁠[Date(1) / POSIXct(1) / POSIXlt(1) / NULL]⁠</code>
</p>
<p>The reference date time value. The default when left as <code>NULL</code> is the
epoch time of <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠1970-01-01 00:00:00⁠</code>, <em>in the time zone of the index</em>.
</p>
<p>This is generally used to define the anchor time to count from, which is
relevant when the every value is <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠&gt; 1⁠</code>.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The return value of <code>warp_distance()</code> has a variety of uses. It can be used
for:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> A grouping column in a <code>dplyr::group_by()</code>. This is especially useful for
grouping by a multitude of a particular period, such as "every 5 months".
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Computing distances between values in <code>x</code>, in units of the <code>period</code>.
By returning the distances from the <code>origin</code>, <code>warp_distance()</code> has also
implicitly computed the distances between values of <code>x</code>. This is used
by <code>slide::block()</code> to break the input into time blocks.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When the time zone of <code>x</code> differs from the time zone of <code>origin</code>, a warning
is issued, and <code>x</code> is coerced to the time zone of <code>origin</code> without changing
the number of seconds of <code>x</code> from the epoch. In other words, the time zone
of <code>x</code> is directly changed to the time zone of <code>origin</code> without changing the
underlying numeric representation. <strong>It is highly advised to specify an
<code>origin</code> value with the same time zone as <code>x</code>.</strong> If a <code>Date</code> is used for
<code>x</code>, its time zone is assumed to be <code>"UTC"</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A double vector containing the distances.
</p>


<h3>Period</h3>

<p>For <code>period</code> values of <code>"year"</code>, <code>"month"</code>, and <code>"day"</code>, the information
provided in <code>origin</code> is truncated. Practically this means that if you
specify:
</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre>warp_distance(period = "month", origin = as.Date("1970-01-15"))
</pre></div>
<p>then only <code>1970-01</code> will be used, and not the fact that the origin starts
on the 15th of the month.
</p>
<p>The <code>period</code> value of <code>"quarter"</code> is internally
<code style="white-space: pre;">⁠period = "month", every = every * 3⁠</code>. This means that for <code>"quarter"</code>
the month specified for the <code>origin</code> will be used as the month to start
counting from to generate the 3 month quarter.
</p>
<p>To mimic the behavior of <code>lubridate::floor_date()</code>, use <code>period = "week"</code>.
Internally this is just <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠period = "day", every = every * 7⁠</code>. To mimic the
<code>week_start</code> argument of <code>floor_date()</code>, set <code>origin</code> to a date
with a week day identical to the one you want the week to start from. For
example, the default origin of <code>1970-01-01</code> is a Thursday, so this would be
generate groups identical to <code>floor_date(week_start = 4)</code>.
</p>
<p>The <code>period</code> value of <code>"yday"</code> is computed as complete <code>every</code>-day periods
from the <code>origin</code>, with a forced reset of the <code>every</code>-day counter every
time you hit the month-day value of the <code>origin</code>. <code>"yweek"</code> is built on top
of this internally as <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠period = "yday", every = every * 7⁠</code>. This ends up
using an algorithm very similar to <code>lubridate::week()</code>, with the added
benefit of being able to control the <code>origin</code> date.
</p>
<p>The <code>period</code> value of <code>"mday"</code> is computed as <code>every</code>-day periods within
each month, with a forced reset of the <code>every</code>-day counter
on the first day of each month. The most useful application of this is
<code>"mweek"</code>, which is implemented as <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠period = "mday", every = every * 7⁠</code>. This
allows you to group by the "week of the month". For <code>"mday"</code> and <code>"mweek"</code>,
only the year and month parts of the <code>origin</code> value are used. Because of
this, the <code>origin</code> argument is not that interesting for these periods.
</p>
<p>The <code>"hour"</code> period (and more granular frequencies) can produce results
that might be surprising, even if they are technically correct. See the
vignette at <code>vignette("hour", package = "warp")</code> for more information.
</p>


<h3>Precision</h3>

<p>With <code>POSIXct</code>, the limit of precision is approximately the microsecond
level. Only dates that are very close to the unix origin of 1970-01-01 can
possibly represent microsecond resolution correctly (close being within
about 40 years on either side). Otherwise, the values past the microsecond
resolution are essentially random, and can cause problems for the distance
calculations. Because of this, decimal digits past the microsecond range are
zeroed out, so please do not attempt to rely on them. It should still be safe
to work with microseconds, by, say, bucketing them by millisecond distances.

DSM_SingularValues

</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A numeric vector of length 2623.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data were obtained by singular value decomposition of a term-document matrix representing 100,000 Wikipedia articles, with 2623 target terms from a Basic English vocabulary.  Articles were truncated to the first ca. 500 words.  Occurrence frequencies of the target terms were log-scaled and rows of the matrix were L2-normalized before applying the SVD.

<h2>Calculates bivariate Pearson, Spearman, polychoric, and polyserial correlation coefficients</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculates bivariate Pearson, Spearman, polychoric, and polyserial correlation
coefficients in weighted or unweighted form, on discrete or continuous variables. Also 
calculates tetrachoric and biserial correlation coefficients as described below.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">weightedCorr(
  x,
  y,
  method = c("Pearson", "Spearman", "Polyserial", "Polychoric"),
  weights = rep(1, length(x)),
  ML = FALSE,
  fast = TRUE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numeric (or numeric factor in case of polychoric) vector or an object that can be
coerced to a numeric or factor vector.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>y</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numeric vector (or factor in case of polychoric and polyserial) or an object that
can be coerced to a numeric or factor vector.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character string indicating which correlation coefficient is
to be computed. These include "Pearson" (default), "Spearman", "Polychoric", or "Polyserial".
For tetrachoric use "Polychoric" and for biserial use "Polyserial".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>weights</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numeric vector of weights. By default, the unweighted correlation coefficient is calculated
by setting the weights to a vector of all 1s.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ML</code></td>
<td>
<p>a Boolean value indicating if full Maximum Likelihood (ML) is to be used (polyserial and polychoric only,
has no effect on Pearson or Spearman results). This substantially increases the
compute time. See the 'wCorr Arguments' vignette for a description of the effect of this argument.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>fast</code></td>
<td>
<p>a Boolean value indicating if the Rcpp methods should be used. Setting this value to FALSE
uses the pure R implementation and is included primarily for comparing the implementations
to each other. See the 'wCorr Arguments' vignette for a description of the effect of this argument.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In case of polyserial, x must be the observed ordinal variable, and y the observed continuous variable. For
polychoric, both must be categorical. The correlation methods are calculated as described in the 'wCorr Formulas'
vignette.
</p>
<p>For Spearman the data is first ranked and then a Pearson type correlation coefficient is calculated on
the result. The ranking method gives averages for ties.
</p>
<p>The details of computation are given in the 'wCorr Formulas' vignette.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A scalar that is the estimated correlation.
